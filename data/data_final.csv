Captain Lee's blog post about the Below Deck episode from last night (S06E12) ,1
"Can we discuss how the parties work? The parties on RH always have a weird vibe to them. Like the people in the background are just standing around like they were hired. They always look like there's only a few people at the parties (I've noticed this with RHONY more than RHOBH), and no one ever thinks twice about these ladies screaming at each other. Do you think they're parties put together just for production? Or do you think they're real parties, and they tell everyone who attends ""we'll be filming here, avoid talking to the ladies or looking at the cameras"" and everyone goes along with it because they're excited to be on tv? I don't get it.",1
"RHOA Season 6: Porsha and the girls I‚Äôve been binge rewatching this season because I‚Äôm poorly and I need a good laugh but I wanted to share some points/conclusions I‚Äôve made comparing the relationships between the ladies then and now.

* Kandi: she‚Äôs such a good person and had such a softer heart when it came to dealing with the ladies and the way she always went to bat for Phaedra is sad knowing what happens 3 years later. Also - she was the only housewife who always tried to rally everyone for Porsha during her divorce and offered her all kinds of support to help her become a self sufficient woman.

* Nene: She was definitely feeling herself this season and you can see with the way she is treating and talking to the ladies. Although I understand how her relationship with Cynthia went because of her calling Peter a bitch but it felt like such a random turnaround when it comes to Kenya. She went from going out house hunting with her to ignoring her and saying they were never friends. I do feel like Nene suffered the cancellation of The New Normal and I feel as though she felt threatened by Kenya as the new star of RHOA. So maybe some background interference?

* Porsha: I don‚Äôt think she truly valued the help that the women did for her. Kandi gave her opportunities and was a true friend, Cynthia gave her a shoulder to cry on and gave good advice to her and Porsha was probably the only person Nene was sincerely kind to. I can‚Äôt help but feel as though her future issues with Cynthia derived from her husbands relationship with her ex Kordell Stewart and it got worse from there. Her future issues with Kandi was just her being spiteful and being buddy with Phaedra and helped to try and take her down. It‚Äôs a shame because I loved the sweet and kind Porsha who had some fire when it came to Kenya. 

* Phaedra: I don‚Äôt take care what anyone says but Apollo was truly trash towards her. He never acknowledged his wrongdoings when it came to dealing with Kenya. He should‚Äôve just apologised and agreed to never deal with her because it made her feel uncomfortable. Everything else seems to be all on Phaedra. Her anger towards Todd created the future situations and it‚Äôs just all terrible and horrible.



 



That‚Äôs all I really have to say.

"Do we know how the confessionals work? I've been trying to figure this out from the start. It appears like the ladies are reacting to what is currently playing for us, but obviously they're not, and I understand the interviews are filmed several times throughout the course of the season (since they have clothing changes and whatnot), but some of their commentary seems too specific and off the cuff to be entirely scripted. Are they asked questions, and they're responding to questions? Are they showed certain clips, and then filmed responding to the clips? Do they keep journals so they know what they're going to talk about? I don't get it :/ ",1

"Bravo editing scenes in trailers With the upcoming BH trailer coming. Many people speculate it will be a boring season so Bravo tends to try to twist scenes into making it appear to be more dramatic when it isn't. 


So what scenes do you remember from trailers or previews where Bravo has edited the scene to appear more dramatic or even just a lie. I feel like Bravo has learned their lesson and hasn't done that very often anymore. 


I remember one where Bh season 2 Camille goes ""you need to be more honest, because thats not right"", then it cuts to Kyle but we all know its actually to Taylor in the actual episode.

"What are Bravo catchphrases you now use in everyday life? I'm curious what Bravo catchphrases have made their way into your vernacular?? Especially interested in phrases you use with people even when they aren't into Bravo/RH.

I've started to use ""word on the street"" because of Gizelle a LOT at work when talking to anybody about anything I heard from someone else. ""Word on the street is you're redoing this draft"" or ""word on the street is you're gonna go meet with \[customer\] next week"" or whatever. I always kinda try to say it like Gizelle does, like elongating street a little and dipping low on ""is"" before a sliiight pause haha. I've actually found it to be a pretty practical phrase, and it doesn't register as a reference for most people, though occasionally I get a ""what street??"" reaction haha.

I also have a coworker who loves RHOBH who always says ""You stole my goddamn \[blank\]"" whenever I borrow something like a pen or whatever, then I call her a liar and an alcoholic, it cracks us up. I wouldn't ever use either with someone who wasn't familiar with the origin though haha.",1

"Lycra &amp; Legwarmers....A RHONY charity event Hi Everyone! I had the opportunity to attend a really cool event in NYC last night.  It was a an 80‚Äôs aerobics class led by Dorinda and fitness guru John Giswold to benefit a great organization called Live Out Loud which inspires and empowers LGBT youth by connecting them with successful LGBT professionals in their community.  

Since Dorinda was hosting we knew she was a guarantee, but the event was ‚Äúbeing filmed‚Äù so we had high hopes that other Housewives would be there and boy did this event deliver.  Bethenny, Ramona, Sonja, LuAnn and newbie Barbara were all there.  The only one missing was Tinsley.....sadly her dog Bambi passed away a few days ago and Dorinda said she was not up to attending.  

I also had the chance to meet a fellow Reddit contributor here, the gorgeous and super nice /u/booblet 

So that was really cool too! 

We had to sign waivers on the way in so we might actually end up on the show this season (how cool would that be?) All the housewives participated in the class and were smiling throughout.  There were some heavy conversations being filmed after the aerobics ended and the ladies seemed to be bickering about something.  It‚Äôs so surreal to actually see them filming.  There‚Äôs a lot of crew members and the director is constantly adjusting peoples positions for better camera angles, etc. The director was also super strict about ‚Äúno photos‚Äù while they were filming so we waited after the class in the hallway and got pics with everyone.  

Overall a great night for a good cause!

"What's wrong with VPR? Watching the latest episodes of VPR, then seeing the casts interviews and tweets has kind of shook me. 

It's not just they are producing themselves like Kristen is clearly producing herself as some kind of tellenovella villian/anti-hero, but it seems like there is a pre-season discussed narrative of phrases they should use, things they should do and say, on some level, the actions of the cast are what bullying looks like in workplaces and schools around the world. 

Lets take Kristens reaction to James and James attacking Katie for her weight. On a surface level James is wrong for body shaming. On a greater level, he is being bullied. Kristen has decided, even though it has nothing to do with her, to bring in someone to expose James, Katie even used times up, which is either an always Sunny reference or them referencing the times up movement, which is exposing predators in workplaces/society, something that doesn't apply to James just because they all hate him. Kristen has said online shes exposing him and all his victims and she hated him because he spat on her door (I mean she punched him in the face). 

Harnassing the times up movement is problematic because they are enmeshed in this cycle of bad behaviour, and not only that, they are pushing James and his gf down, whilst holding up and celebrating Jax, who has done far worse things, its the stunning hypocrisy that bothers me.  Seeing Raquel confronted, abused for believing and staying with her cheating BF and on that same episode Brittany getting a party for staying with her cheating emotionally abusive bf makes me uncomfortable, I mean it has to be deliberate editor shade, one woman is given a party and one woman is condemned. Even worse, its the expectation they should all be applauded for isolating a person or blaming all their shit on James/Scheana/Raquel. 

I know the premise of the show is conflict, but we have James, who is already on the outs with everyone, being confronted by Kristen, who was forcing him to leave, then Katie and others chime in, but the start point, its none of her business. Kristen is trying to isolate James, from a group, using information that has nothing to do with her, then Katie and the whole group comes over and chimes in. Has anyone ever had a group ambush you with a confrontation they had clearly planned in advance? That is fucked up. Not even that, poor sweet, Robot Raquel was again abused for actions that weren't even her own. 

Back to Jax, people are swearing up and down he's changed, he's online starting fights with Scheana (who was actually his only friend when cheated with Kristen) and James, shaming Scheana for dating even though we have seen his disgusting mistreatment of women for years and going from person to person. It feels like gaslighting, suddenly, the core group isn't doing shitty things right now so they as a group, never call each other out, act like it never happened. They always had someone to scapegoat for most of their shitty behaviour and its ongoing. 

edit, also Katie championing herself as a body warrior, also apparently not wanting to work for someone who has a ""bully"" in her workplace, which again, is manipulative because she has been extremely abusive to her loved ones and inserted herself into a conflict that was already spiralling. Like wtf is going on. IMO it looks like systematic bullying because they have planned a bunch of ways to attack a person, then when they react poorly claim themselves as victims. How am I supposed to believe a credible body warrior narrative when Katie leads with a pointed comment about someones body, knowing she has all her own issues. ",1

A show centered around one of the older housewive children: Maybe about Kara Keough and her family or something like that. I'd also like seeing a show about one of the kids in their 20's and their life post college. 

I feel like a show like any of these would really fill a void I'm feeling, What about you?",1

"RHONY Included in Top 20 TV Series of 2018 by Daily Beast The Daily Beast published their list of the top 2018 TV series and RHONY came in at #16. Here's an excerpt from the article:


""The inclusion of a show like this on a list like this can give off whiffs of cheeky trolling. But with reality TV as omnipresent and as popular as ever, due credit is owed to the iteration of the genre that has mastered it all, from unabashed trashiness to astute cultural commentary. There was plenty of both in the monumental 10th season, which barreled onto Bravo this fall with two headline-making storylines already on viewers‚Äô minds: Bethenny Frankel‚Äôs renegade relief charity work and Luann de Lesseps‚Äô shocking New Year‚Äôs Eve arrest, Houdini handcuffs escape, and ensuing journey toward sobriety.

The rest of the season explored the repercussions of drinking while privileged‚Äîboth through de Lesseps‚Äô struggles but also in concern over friend Dorinda Medley‚Äôs alcohol consumption‚Äîthe slow, painful dissolution of a friendship; the wild comedy of a ‚Äúboat trip from hell‚Äù; and somehow, a throughline of scenes involving poop. Whether you cringed or couldn‚Äôt look away, all eyes were still on New York‚Äôs ladies who lunch.""",1

"I DO DUBROW! Phase 2: Summer Is Coming AKA Death By Farts Hi guys!!! After three weeks on Phase Two of the oft heralded Dubrow Diet, I'm ready to move it along. For those of you who may be unfamiliar with Phase One of the Diet, I'll do a quick recap: You eat an obscenely small amount of food during an absurd amount of time and try not to end up pantsless and catatonic in a Denny's a 3 am, sleep-gorging your way through someone else's Moon's Over MyHammie. It's fasting, and Keto, and systematic bullying that instructs you to eat during an 8 hour window and fast over the following 16. When you do eat, it will be two high protein, low (if any) carb meals coupled with one turkey pinwheel disguised under the code name ""snack"" and, know this, these will leave you even more unfulfilled than Allison Dubois could ever predict. You are only allowed to do this for a maximum of five days because even an hour more will put your life, or the lives of service workers employed with in a seventeen mile radius of your zipcode, in peril. I started (Nov 11) at a respectable weight of 191.4 and upon weighing myself after Phase One (Nov 18) and I had dropped to 176.6 and that is where we begin...

&amp;#x200B;

Phase Two boasts an increased menu, and that is true, but try as I may, I could not find 'ham sandwich' anywhere on the augmented food list. There are fats (ACTUAL oil, nut butter, avocado) dairy (mozzarella cheese, Greek yogurt) and protein (CLAMS) additions. But if a fun meal of oily-yogurt-clams isn't your cup of tea, you can also add carrots and hummus to this list, which let me just tell you, as someone who has been snacking on purse-turkey and Satan's salad (kale) everyday at 3pm, this...was almost like praying. Here's a sample menu from one of my days on Phase Two:

&amp;#x200B;

11am: Eggwhite Omelette w/spinach, broccoli and salsa, cooked in 1 tbsp of oil. Ezekiel toast (because I hate my Dad) with almond butter and coffee w/ oat milk ( because I'm a joiner). Greek style Cashew Yogurt (unfortunately called Cashewgurt) and blueberries.

&amp;#x200B;

3pm: 4 tbsp Hummus with broccoli, cucumber, peppers, carrots and cauliflower cut into millions of tiny stick shapes to trick your brain into thinking you are eating more of these than you are-THIS WILL NOT ACTUALLY TRICK YOUR BRAIN-your brain is not stupid, your brain instinctually knows what to do if you ever find yourself face to face with a cheetah, your brain knows what this is, however, the act of creating millions of tiny stick shapes out of these vegetables will, in fact, burn most of the calories you will consume by eating them. (Note: The book only allows three tbsp and to that I respectfully say ''fuck off, Heather"", because there is no such thing as a three tbsp serving of hummus).

&amp;#x200B;

7pm: 4-5oz of rosemary chicken breast w/shredded cabbage, cucumber and carrot sauteed with soy sauce and ginger. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did this nonsensnse (or a reasonable facimile of this nonsense) for the entire three weeks save for two cheat days. These are allowed on Phase Two as long as you still maintain the same eating schedule (8 on/16 off).

&amp;#x200B;

My first cheat was on Thanksgiving. I made it through most of the day, until my brother-in-law brought out pie. Here's the thing, Do you remember when RHOBH had that Tiny Cheesecake Party with Carnie Wilson? And remember how the ladies kept saying things like ""OMG, these are so good""! while taking fifteen bites of a dime-sized cheesecake? Upon first watch, I thought they were all just laying it on thick because it was Carnie Wilson, and by Famous People rules, a Past-Her-Prime-Carnie-Wilson still trumps a Richards sister (I do not make the rules, but my mother does during NCIS commercial breaks and she does NOT know what a Kyle is), BUT THEY WERE NOT...I think those teeny tiny cheesecakes WERE the greatest things they have ever eaten, because it had been SO LONG since any of them had had a complex carbohydrate or a sugar that their tastebuds were in total rapture: This is what it was like when I ate a bite of my husband's pie (that is not a euphemism). It was JUST pumpkin pie, but it tasted like what Heaven must smell like. So I said to myself ""have a whole piece"" so, naturally, I had two...and a cookie...three cookies. In my defense, these cookies were shaped like turkeys and gourdes so all I saw was protein and tubers (also, i deserved them). A week later, my next ""cheat"" was such bullshit, I hate to even count it-it was a pint of Halo Top ""Ice Cream"" (and I do use that term quite loosely). Halo Top Ice Cream is like sex in the afternoon but then you get a phone call from an unknown number and you start to think it might be your son's school, but, its probably not, but then...yikes...you aren't sure, so you keep going but all you can think about is how you are a terrible parent because he might be bleeding in the nurses office, or worse, and that it shows up as an unknown number because she has a weird extension that doesn't show up like lady in the Main Office does, but no, you're too busy being a base, disgusting, carnal person to care about your possibly toothless, bleeding son, who they might be taking to the hospital for facial reconstruction because he is so heinously deformed now that you will only be able to recognize him by his shoes, but who knows, because you wouldn't answer because it was an unknown number and then BAM...your husband is done. THAT is what Halo Top Ice Cream tastes like.  After that, I just decided that I would only cheat if it was something worth cheating for like a huge piece of chocolate cake, an Umami Burger, buffalo wings FROM Buffalo or Jared Leto. 

&amp;#x200B;

Upside: I cannot deny i am eating more healthily...healthfully...better than I have in, possibly ever. I'm getting a lot of bang-for my-buck calorie-wise, more veggies than ever and I'm actually thinking about what I'm eating and when I'm eating it. I weighted myself right before I wrote this and as of an hour ago, I was 171.8.

&amp;#x200B;

Downside: This part is going to take trust on both our parts. Sure, people make up stories on reddit all the time for karma, just look at the Justin Bieber sideways burrito or Kameron Westcott's AT&amp;T bill, but this...this is not one of those times. Just so that you know exactly how serious I am, I'd like share some things about me with you in an act of good faith: I was given up for adoption by my birth mother, without my birth father knowing, because his family wanted to raise me as his sibling. See, that wasn't so bad. I once was a touring member of the nation's premier Christian Skit Drama Ministry. Yikes. Sigh. I like Grease 2 better than Grease.  Good...we're together now? Here it goes: I shit myself while on Phase Two. Now, I'm not saying The Dubrow Diet made me shit myself, but I WILL say that if I wasn't on the Dubrow Diet, it never would've happened. There are a lot of healthy choices on the DD Menu. I....don't think my body was ready for them. Also, there's A LOT of coffee happening. A LOT. Let me just say, that if you are going to attempt this diet. Do NOT trust that gas is truly and only gas. 99% of the time, you will be right....but 1...1 fateful, little percent will happen upon you, in a parking garage, on a Tuesday, while you are trying to secure your 3 mo old's baby seat to its car base. DO NOT, (this cannot be stressed enough), DO NOT, pass gas arbitrarily on this diet.  You think you know...and then you don't and then it's all over and you miss a eyelash tint. Honestly, there were about two or three days after that, where I just stayed home...in case. It's traumatizing, demoralizing and the only silver-lining is that I hope this happens to Heather at least once an Autumn. 

 

I'm proud of myself: One week on Phase One,Three weeks on Phase Two and Two more weeks on Phase Three and this body will be ready to turn some Upstate New York Heads! Oh...and unlock the confidence inside of me that I never knew I..yada yada yada...Erika Jayne TED Talk. I cannot end this without saying that this sub is the BEST sub there is. I'm so grateful to have found you.  

 

EDIT: You people are the salt of the Earth. So much love and gratitude. Thank you. ",1

"Can anyone summarize the history of family feuding in RHONJ? Husband here trying to watch with wife. Yes, I'm here to support her by watching side-by-side. She's been watching since day 1. I've seen smatterings of episodes throughout the seasons and have a vague idea of the main players and some drama... and I've been watching every episode for the last 2 seasons, but there's obviously massive gaps in my knowledge. I unfortunately don't have the time (for real) to rewatch every season myself, and my lady is not very prepared or capable of giving me the long history cliffnotes.

So, areas I'd LOVE everyone's input on..

- I've watched bits of the Giudice and Gorga drama for years. Watched Joe scream ""YAW MY FAWDA!"" to his dad (no idea wtf that was about). Saw the two Joes fight one time by ramming each other like buffalos in heat. Saw Prison Joe rip on his wife on that phonecall. I sort of understand that Theresa wants to have sex with her brother and will never not be jealous of Melissa for that reason. I also understand the new beef that's boiling around them not visiting the dad enough. However, I feel like there's a lot of insider knowledge around these families that I don't know, like allegedly Gorga's ripped off their parents to afford that giant mansion? Anything else critical I should know?

- So, exactly what's the deal with the Manzos? I was aware of them and got the impression that they were a powerhouse in the show. Where did they go? Why did they leave? Who were they at war with? Theresa? Why? How did that even get started? All I have in my brain are these insane one-liners from the Manzos about ""family"" and ""thick as thieves"" and all these crazy intense platitudes. It felt like there was some deep venom. What exactly... happened? I feel like this is a huge epic chapter in the series that I have absolutely no knowledge on. 

- And what was the deal with that lady Jacqueline? Why was she so reviled? I think I saw some of her in her debut season (episodes here and there) and vaguely remember thinking she was just quiet and meek and uninteresting. I also knew she had an autistic kid so I felt sympathy for that. Then years go by and I get wind that shes the most villified person ever, everyone can't stand her, she's a mental case, and that she's also at war with &lt;insert people here&gt;. What .... happened there? What was her beef about and with who? How did it end and what'd she do to make you all hate her so much (over someone like, say, Theresa?)

- What ever happened to that blonde from the first season? Wasn't she related to the Manzos? Why did she disappear? Didn't some dark things happen in her life that were never shared? Is there anything known about this?

- What happened to that couple with the husband who looked like Jeff Goldblum? Were they just too nice and boring for the show? Were they also BFFs with Theresa in the same way that Delores is? 

- What happened to the Gorga restaurant? Does that thing still exist? Also... what exactly IS Joe Gorga job? Has anyone done any sleuthing on that? Is it 100% legit..?

- Finally... how does Danielle fit into all of this? Is she just an independent wildcard of chaos? Was she embroiled with Theresa and the Manzos? Was all of her beef and drama related to other family drama, or is it all specific unrelated stuff that is unique to Danielle?

I think the Jacqueline and Manzo stuff is really my biggest gap in knowledge and I feel like I'd be a better and more well rounded RHONJ viewer if I sort of had that context.

Anyhoo. Thanks anyone willing to help.",1

But funny Jax is forgiven for doing the actual cheating. They really need to grow a spine and stop getting offended over a bit of ball breaking.

Edit- and of course Jax is milking it because it falls off attention from what a terrible person he is. As long as James is the bad guy, Jax can pretend to be the good guy. And as usual, the cast falls for this sociopaths manipulative tactics.",1

I don't like all the women attacking 1 woman; I would much prefer them to be on opposite teams or something. It's been a bit more balanced since Kam was added but there's still a sense that Brandi wants all the women to not befriend LeeAnne. I just don't think that's fair to anyone.

"What lessons have you learnt from watching Real Housewives. I know some people might think jokingly but I was just thinking about what serious life lessons ect you have learnt from watching different franchises of the show.

Personally for me it is to always confront someone when you are clearly getting screwed over by them, or at least tell people honestly how you feel. Luckily for the ladies on the show its easier for lies to get caught out by the cameras. But its always good seeing people get redemption when someone messes with them bad.

Also to always tell people you care about you love them. Seeing Vicky (even though I despise her) get the call that her mother passed away and her reaction was one of the hardest scenes to watch.

"How to save RHBOH? A Breakdown. Sorry for the long post, and misspelling RHOBH. I'm typing on my phone :-/

&amp;#x200B;

Remember when RHOBH was THE ultimate RH show? The women were fun, interesting, kinda eccentric, and insanely rich. I mean, Adrienne was a billionaire who co-owned a major league basketball team! That level of wealth had never been seen before, on reality TV. The show did a great job of showcasing the lives of the rich, while also letting us know how painful, and harsh things could be. We watched story-lines that dealt with suicide, infidelity, alcohol abuse, classism, illness, divorce, sibling rivalry, and the desperate need to have ""it all"". There were favorites, and hated HWs, but they all brought something to the table. I would consider seasons 1-3 as the golden age, of RHOBH. So, what went wrong, and how can we save the show?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Season 4 was the season where Carlton and Joyce joined the cast. Instead of bringing something interesting to the show, like the last newcomer-Brandi did, they were duds. Carlton was hated because she came off as ""weird"". She tried to seem ""eccentric"", but we saw it as trying too hard. Her nonstop anti-Kyle stance got old, as did her overly-provocative persona. Meanwhile, Joyce was just plain boring. As the first Latina HW, on the show, I think people expected her to be full of Spanish Sofia Vergara-esque flair. Kinda like the ladies from Miami. When Brandi came for her, out of nowhere, she wasn't able to bring the drama we like to see on reality TV. She chose to take the high road, and largely ignored Brandi's rudeness. When they'd have a confrontation, Brandi would usually come out on top, because Joyce backed down ever time. Unfortunately, she wasn't tough enough for reality TV. Also, we saw the first cracks in Yolanda's popularity, when she formed her sort-lived ""dream team"". Until then, she was one of the favorites, on the show.  At this point, the show was still OK, because we got to see the ultimate HW fight, with Brandi and Lisa. That was the main storyline that saved season 4, however, the show had lost a lot of it's fun by that time.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Season 5 was much better than the last season, because Rinna and Eileen brought something fresh to the show, and made it interesting again. Rinna brought drama, and Eileen brought a sense of stability. Personally, I think season 5 was one of the best RHOBH seasons. Highlights included the whole Amsterdam trip, Eileen's poker night, the beginning of Rinna vs Kim, and Eileen becoming a much-needed voice of reason. It was the end of Brandi's time on the show, and she became a caricature of herself.

&amp;#x200B;

\-In my opinion season 6 was the beginning of the end. Erika was added, and she was a breath of fresh air, for a bit. However, the show got bogged down with the #Munchenhausenhausen scandal. The same issue was brought up over, and over for several episodes. Is Yolanda telling the truth? Is she faking it? Did LVP do something shady? What does Rinna think about it? What does Kyle think about it? What's wrong with Yolanda? It was kinda painful to watch. Kathryn was added, but her big ""OJ moment"" fizzled out, and she brought nothing to the table. Former favorite, Yolanda was out, Eileen's popularity declined because she wouldn't let go of the LVP apology drama. Erika vs LVP didn't go anywhere. A trip to incredible Dubai, one of the most howewives-friendly cities, was a dud. The LVP drama refused to die. Yolanda and David got divorced. It was a terrible season.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Seasons 7-8 officially killed the show, in my opinion. Adding Dorit was a terrible mistake. The viewers didn't find her fun, interesting, fascinating, or entertaining to watch. She wasn't even fun to hate. I was actually kinda OK with her, when gross PK wasn't around. LVP and Kyle refused to get involved with drama, which makes them boring af. Nobody wants to see LVP and Kyle fake a friendship for two seasons. We want to see them get their hands dirty, like they did before. They barely have opinions on the ""drama"", if you can call it that. Sadly, Dorit has been carrying the show with the ""Pantygate/Champagne Glass-Gate"". Rinna has decided to use her platform to turn her daughters into the next big thing in the fashion world. Once fun, and cool, Erika has lost popularity. She's become predictable, and her act has grown old, with the viewers. The best part of either season were Erika going crazy in Hong Kong, Camille as a ""friend-of"", and Rinna's ""coke in the bathroom"" accusation. Teddy brought nothing to the show. She seems nice. We don't want nice. We want to see some kind of personality, other than ""I like horses"".

&amp;#x200B;

So, how can the once-great HW show be saved? I thought of a few ways:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Make Kyle and LVP bring some drama that doesn't involve ""LVP manipulates us"". We're tired of that old, pointless story-line that will never bring down LVP. She's to smart for it, and every HW that tried to pull it off, has failed. Even in a group. They'll fail again in season 9. If LVP/Kyle refuse to bring some kind of entertainment factor to the show, fire them. Replace them with Camille. She's an OG, who can still bring drama. We've seen her be the old, snarky Camille in season 8, when she feuded with Dorit. We'd have that familiar season 1-2 feel, with her as an official HW.
2. Get rid of Erika, Teddy, and Dorit. Erika's schtick has overstayed it's welcome, and Dorit's was never welcomed. Teddy doesn't bring anything to the show.
3. Make Rinna get even messier. She's at her best when she ""owns it"". We need ""were people doing coke in your bathroom?"", and less Kris Jenner Jr.
4. Replace LVP, Kyle, Teddy, Dorit with housewives from different ethnic backgrounds. Beverly Hills is very diverse, and full of crazy rich Asians, Russians, Indians, Germans, Saudis, Europeans, Persians, Israelis, and African Americans. It would be cool to see those communities explored, in a franchise like this.
5. Bring back Eileen. Yes, she was kinda boring, but we need a voice of reason. She's very likable, and has an interesting life.
6. Add an actual celebrity, like Denise Richards. However, make sure she's an active part of the cast. From what I've heard Denise won't be spending much time with the HWs, in season 9. What's the point of having her as a cast-member, if she doesn't want to be a part of it?
7. Make most of the drama lighthearted, but not tedious. The show got way too serious, and isn't much fun, when they are arguing about serious topics like alcoholism or addiction. Dorit's version of drama isn't serious, but watching that was just annoying.
8. Make sure all the HWs know each other, before filming starts. That way, we don't have to sit through forced introduction scenes. Also, the show seems more authentic when the women all know each-other.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any other ideas, on how to make RHOBH interesting again?

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: RHOBH got boring and lame. It used to be so much better. Changes need to be made, so it becomes fun to watch, like RHONY, RHOD, AND RHONJ. What do you think should be done to save the show?

"Update: Sharing my WWHL experience [Photos from WWHL](https://imgur.com/gallery/pp4cgpE) 

Sorry for the delay everyone!

The Clubhouse is located in Tribeca, so took the train in from Jersey City and it brought us about 5 blocks away which was so convenient. My friend and I waited inside in the lobby where the audience coordinator would bring everyone up to the 7th floor where the studio is. As we were waiting TYRA BANKS AND MEGAN FOX walked right by me. They were filming the taping for last nights show, which obviously wasn‚Äôt live. Someone asked Tyra for a photo, she declined. Then she went outside and paparazzi started taking photos and she took pictures with fans out there (probably because it was being documented). Megan Fox smiled at me, she looks like a porcelain doll and is SO small. Tyra is so skinny and alarmingly tall. 

After going upstairs, they held us in a waiting area that had a bar, some TVs, and backdrops that look like you‚Äôre in the clubhouse. They aired the finale of Dallas and played music while we all chatted and took photos. I saw Leeanne and Melissa and Joe Gorga walking behind the backdrop to get to set. Joe Gorga has to be like 5‚Äô5‚Äù max. They were promoting both of Andy‚Äôs books. You could get a personalized signature on them if you purchased, you weren‚Äôt able to meet Andy or anything, but you were getting the books at a discounted rate. 

Once it was time to go in to the studio and be seated, the gave us some rules and guidelines (no heckling, phones only allowed during commercial breaks, bring the energy when they give you the signals, etc). Seating assignments were pre-arranged. 

The studio is really much smaller than you expect it to be even after hearing in the past it‚Äôs small. There‚Äôs about 3 rows of seats that fit MAYBE 30 people. So I understand why it‚Äôs so hard to get tickets. 

Andy comes out and chats with the audience for just about a minute, asking us if he‚Äôs shorter than we expected (haha). He then introduced Melissa and leeanne and they took their seats and got ready to start the show! 

It all went by so fast but you also stay seated for the aftershow which is cool. 

Leeanne is such a legend I love her so much (made sure to scream that at her during commercial break and she returned the sentiment). Melissa is breathtakingly beautiful in person. Her skin is flawless and made me immediately want to make a Botox appointment. 

Melissa genuinely got emotional during the aftershow when someone asked about Joe Guidice‚Äôs deportation. I felt for her. During the main part of the show when Andy brought up Teresa, Melissa would roll her eyes so hard when the camera wasn‚Äôt focusing on her, I could feel her frustration. Joe would take a sip of his drink at the mention of his sister and did a good job of not letting any emotions show on his face. 

Once their done taping you are out of there pretty quickly and on your way!

I hope I didn‚Äôt forget any details so if anyone has questions, let me know! All in all, amazing experience and I‚Äôm so grateful. Definitely a bucket list item for me. ",1

"I really like ‚ÄúBuying it Blind‚Äù I was really worried when Bravo made a change to it‚Äôs schedule and programming (BravoHome, I think) on Friday nights. However, I caught one episode of ‚ÄúBuying it Blind‚Äù and really liked it. I think the concept is interesting: people give their life savings to a real estate agent that looks like Jennifer Aniston, a fabulous designer, and someone who is knowledgeable about the construction process. They then buy them a house and redesign it to fit their personality. I cannot imagine ever doing something like this myself; but I love watching other people do it :)

"Jennifer (RHONJ) Appreciation Thread ""Hi Jennifer,"" ""Jennifer what are you doing on reddit, ""Don't you have 16 bathrooms to not clean.""

Now that I got those out of the way, just wanted to write an appreciation post for Jennifer Aydin on Jersey this season. The majority of the responses I've seen have been ""This woman is satan"" or ""This is why some people shouldn't reproduce."" And while I do agree with both of those, I'm completely here for it.

I'd take the obnoxious villain addition over the agreeable and polite new housewife any day. As much as I like Emily or Gina or Tinsley, I'd be hard-pressed to say that any of them have really made an impression. And while I'd probably be able to be around Jennifer for 10 minutes before wanting to drive into an oak tree, she's perfect for reality tv.

She's just so ridiculous and over-the-top. It's not as if any of her jokes and one-liners are funny, but watching her think they are is wonderful. She's been on the show for a whole four episodes and she's already at the ""What are you going to do about it"" argument stage, despite also saying she wants to get along with everyone and be one of the girls.

Jackie may be the more likable and reasonable new addition, the one you'd actually want to spend time with, but I don't watch these shows to see likable people. And I suppose it should be noted that she did apologize for her situation and did subject herself to a sleeping in the trailer, so I will give her that.

All in all, I don't think I've been this excited for a new addition in a while, and while I agree that she's reprehensible, I can't wait to see what garbage will spew out of her mouth next week.",1

I would have expected Shannon to be more visibly upset and defensive of Kelly, but all she was doing was whispering to Vicki on the side to just not say stuff like that. If judging by previous Shannon behavior, this is something that would have riled up her up in the past (I mean, she was upset when the girls made fun of them having an old lady party), so why is she not? Why does it seem that she's trying so hard to maintain this friendship with this awful unaccountable woman that is never going to change?

"RHOC season 14 - tips for bravo so you‚Äôll actually watch? Casting: 
Get rid of Gina. Not only does she talk like a Newsie and always look like she‚Äôs going to 90s themed costume party, but she‚Äôs secretive and why on earth would bravo cast someone whose husband is forbidden to film??? Not to mention she has no connection with any of the ladies socially or personality wise. 

Emily - yawn, goodbye to your contrived storylines, frozen eggs and exploiting your sick mother on TV. 

Tamra - needs to be demoted to ‚Äúfriend of‚Äù. She can be in the background getting drunk and showing her boobs or getting injured. Beyond that no one cares. 

Keep Vicky, Kelly and Shannon and cast new ladies within their social circle. Like the woman who Vicky set up with Michael. Kelly and Vicky both know her. Cast one of Shannon‚Äôs fellow divorced vodka-drinking, cotillion friends. Bring back Alexis Bellino for Shannon to torture and Kelly to do coke with ... just a few ideas...  stop throwing in randoms. It doesn‚Äôt work! This franchise is dying.  

Letting Tamra produce the same predictable storylines is no longer worth watching. 

Enough with the kids - I don‚Äôt want to see rugrats running around or banging their sippy cups on the high chair tray. 

Maybe shake up the casting team too - after all, these are the people who thought Gina, Peggy and Emily were good ideas.

"The Jax and James Feud, I will always side with Jax. Jax is difficult to stomach and in general his behavior is narcissistic, sociopathic, and just completely wrong. He's cheated, shown evidence that he's a pathological liar, and is just generally an awful example of a human being (atleast, that's how he is portrayed on TV and how he portrays himself on reunions, twitter, and intagram).

There isn't a ""that being said"" here, I just want to point out that the only target of his behavior that has actually probably deserved his literal and figurative abuse is James.  People are getting on his back for his twitter attacks towards the ""DJ"" and people seem to be defending James by pointing out how pathetic he is and how he doesn't need to be kicked when his reputation is already a mangled half dead jellyfish (I don't want to say horse, they're regal creatures and the thought of one half dead makes me sad).

James is someone who has literally gone after Jax and his girlfriend in the lowest way.  I'm going to ignore whatever he's done to Jax, because that has continuously been a two way street between them, but his behavior towards Brittany (thirsty or not) has been incredibly uncalled for. He's called Brittany fat multiple times without apology.  He's literally rapped about Jax cheating on Brittany into a microphone with hundreds of people listening to him, while she was in the room.  Whether or not this was public knowledge doesn't really matter, no ""friend"" would ever do this to someone else, it's really only something an aggresive enemy would do to someone.  To my knowledge Brittany hasn't really done anything to James, his girlfriend, or really anyone. If someone was going after me in this way, I would absolutely hope my husband would step in, especially if that person was a male and friends with my husbands best friends... and I was forced to be in a social situation with them on a regular basis.  It seems like James' irreverent behavior has continued towards her (and all of the girls)... I don't blame Jax for being Jax towards James in this case.  After this much time, if his behavior didn't chVange, I'd probably get petty too.

At this point, James can take it and if he can't, he needs to grow a thicker skin or stop doing things to actually deserve the attacks... He's on a tv show, is making alot more money than most people on this sub, is getting DJ jobs all around Arizona despite his sincere lack of talent, and has a beautiful soul-less toaster of a girlfriend.  I have no pity for him (or Jax for that matter).  Any difficult position he's in right now has been a result of his own actions and decisions. He is, at this point, the only person deserving Jax's stinky dragon breath attacks and I for one say, keep it going, Jax, this is hilarious!",1
"RHOD is Awesome, and D'Andra is a Great Housewives Villain If you're not watching RHOD, you are seriously punishing yourself. It's honestly one of the best housewives shows, right now. It's full of drama, but it's not so heavy that you feel gross watching. All of the housewives bring something interesting to the table, even if you dislike them, individually. It's really silly, rich, campy, fun and reminds me of early seasons RHOBH. If you want real housewives fun, RHOD is for you! It's got everything:

&amp;#x200B;

\-A badass, mentally unstable, one-liner churning carnie-woman who WILL cut a bitch

\-A cute gas-lighting ginger cheerleader, with wild children, who is the epitome of ""mean-girl cheerleader trope""

\-A literal Disney princess

\-A professional ""under-the-bus-thrower"", with a not-gay-at-all husband who likes to dress her in designer clothes

\-An unintentionally funny Barbie, with Ramona Singer levels of self-awareness, who married into Dallas royalty

\-and a badass non-nonsense billionaire, who's domineering mom is a mix of Alexis Carrington, Blanche Devereaux, and Satan. Also, her emotions are like a roller-coaster.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, there haven't been any fun villain on real houewives. Vicki and Tamra are so trashy that it kills the whole show. LVP, Kyle, and Erika have turned RHOBH into a borefest. Nene has become a parody of herself. There are no good, silly Camille Grammer style villains. Anyway, what makes D'Andra such a great villain is that it comes out of nowhere.  In her first season, she was a fan favorite, and her decades-long friendship with Leanne was fun to watch. She didn't take anyone's crap, and was very level-headed. Also, her mom is pure TV gold. I don't think anyone disliked her, so it was interesting to see her turn into an over-emotional villain. She intentionally went after her best-friend, aligned herself with said best friend's main rival on the show, and lost her cool in a way that made for great reality tv. She's not toxic like Vicki, or irrational like Ramona. She has self-awareness, and isn't a slurring drunk like Brandi. She does make good points, and can articulate herself very well when she's not dramatically crying about some first-world issue. Also when she gets mad, it's really funny because she gets really emotional, and scream-cries her arguments at people. She goes from completely rational and level-headed to wildly enraged, in less than a minute over the most ""rich people problems"" things. Judging by the reunion previews, it seems like she's doubling down on her villain-persona. She's the only one on the show who can clash with Leanne, and be entertaining. The show needs someone who can keep Leanne in check, so RHOD doesn't become the Leanne Locken Show. It's never good when one housewife dominates a whole franchise. It will be interesting to see if she completely changes, after seeing herself as a villain, or if stays the way she is, and keeps going after Leanne.

&amp;#x200B;

TL, DR: RHOD is a great show, and D'andra is a fun villain who can stand up to Leanne.

"The sexism of Below Deck After watching the episode where Chandler gets fired and Caroline quits, I am struck at how sexism is such a pervasive theme in this show. Sexism should be discussed more readily and these conversations should be made explicit, simply in the hopes of remedying inequity. Some of this has been fairly explicit:

* Chandler calling Kate a ""glorified housekeeper""
* The entire crew belittling Caroline, in part because she's sensitive
* The three male deckhands minimizing a vocally abrasive Rhylee

While I think it's easier to see sexism against Rhylee, I would argue that sexism equally plagues how the crew treats the stews, but also sexism affects how the audience perceives the stews. Kate is harsh, characterized as a ""bitch"", but we also see her as relatively proficient at her job. Is it a coincidence that we think Kate is proficient at her job? No, I think her harsh exterior makes her proficiency as chief stew more palatable.

I am more surprised by people's reactions to Caroline. Yes, Caroline is sensitive. But I also saw an intelligent and perceptive awareness to Caroline as well. I think it's important to point out that **Caroline was never irrational**. Crying and succumbing to illness were her greatest faults. But it IRKS ME that people call her crazy. ""Crazy"" is what we label women when they are openly sensitive and share their emotions with others.

Does Caroline demonstrate appropriate workplace behavior? No, I'm not justifying her as professional, by any means. But I think Caroline admitted as much in her confessionals. And I think a *really good comparison* to Caroline is ADRIAN. Adrian is also openly sensitive and shares his emotions, but I don't think any of the crew has labeled him as crazy, and I don't hear any one on the sub call him ""crazy"". His behavior is much easier to swallow, and yet his sensitivities definitely affected his work. His refusal to talk, let alone work with both Caroline and Rhylee, are great examples. When Adrian had his tantrums, the rest of the crew just accepted Adrian's reactions as normal. The rest of the crew never challenged or questioned Adrian's reaction. However, Caroline never got the same slack, from both the crew and the audience.

OR the policy was left out of the settlement, in which case it‚Äôs an undivided asset that Don or later his estate could claim an interest. If you have an asset that is left out of the divorce, one person doesn‚Äôt just get to keep it necessarily. 

Third, generally a divorce settlement contains language that the spouses mutually waive their interest as beneficiaries, so even if she is still listed, the policy could deny her claim later on. 

Last, on life insurance the insured (Don) is the technical owner of the policy- not Vicki. At most she is a beneficiary, regardless of who paid the premiums. 

My guess is that Don agreed she could maintain the policy in their settlement. Otherwise, I hope he takes her back to court for the policy, now that she‚Äôs disclosed it. 

This probably irritates me because she is using her authority as an insurance expert to imply she‚Äôs made this brilliant move no one else has thought of and it‚Äôs completely improbable that it happened the way she is saying. ",1

Below Deck Aftershow - Kate delivers a eulogy for Chandler ,1
"Spent the afternoon on the LVP Circuit So I went to California for Thanksgiving to visit my boyfriend's family, and it was a long-ass four day trip y'all (coming from Maine). Because MAH MAN is the best and we spent about 48 hours straight surrounded by his huge family, he let me take the reins on our one free day in LA so obviously I beelined it to West Hollywood. I asked how much he would hate me if we got lunch at Sur and he surprisingly said it was fine. So I drive us there and we park in what I'm pretty sure is THEEEE Sur lot?! Can anyone else corroborate that it's just a public lot outside the back door of Sur? I took a picture and some dude in a car next to me was staring at me like I'm a psycho (I am, hi) but anyway we go to Sur. We made a reservation because you can't be too careful with these things obviously, but we sure as hell didn't need it there was legit one other table. Anyway I try to walk in through the white doors that we always see the cast go through but it's locked so turns out I suck. I go through the actual front door and the host there is obviously stunning and there is some DJ behind her (NOT DJJK SO WTF?) and an also gorgeous server who looked kind of familiar but idk it could just be that they all look the same there. The host starts to bring us in and Y'ALL PETER FUCKING MADRIGAL IS RIGHT THERE and I play it cool but I think I blacked out. I also see what I think could maybe have been Adam at the bar? He was bent down so I couldn't get a good view..does he still work there? Anyway it's pretty empty but we go out back to the garden area I guess, and there's one table of two girls who knew the server, and me and my bf. The server is a gorgeous white man and clearly dgaf about being a SURver, so the service was meh at best (not that my expectations were high). I got two mimosas and my bf doesn't do cocktails so he asked about beer and our server was kind of like ""wtf"" I wonder the last time someone ordered a beer at Sur. At one point Peter walked out back to scan the scene and we made eye contact and holy shit he is even more gorgeous in person. I gushed to my bf (thanks for being a good sport) and tried to lowkey explain the situation about Sur, and who was there etc. The food wasn't bad. We got some apps which were good and I got the french toast but since I was still blacked out I couldn't eat it all. Btw the menu has little notes like ""Jax's go to!"" ""Peter's pick!"" ""All the Vanderpump Rules' pick!"" so I guess they've given up on being a normal restaurant and are embracing that their guests are Bravo freaks like me. So the meal was okay, pricey but not shocking, and super quick. 

We had a lot of time left before we had to go to the airport so I throw my best puppy dog eyes and ask if we can make one more stop at Pump. It's right around the corner! So we walk in and right off the bat it seems more professional than Sur. The servers seem like they actually know what they're doing and aren't just waiting to get on TV. We sat at the bar and got drinks (I GOT A PUMPTINI OF COURSE). It was strong and sweet and huge. I told my bf LVP's line ""Villa Blanca is where you take your wife, SUR is where you take your mistress and PUMP is where you take your boyfriend"" and he loved it. I overheard a girl sitting at the bar with her friends talk about how her friend owns the Malibu Wine Safaris and she was fighting with Whitney Cummings on instagram during the fires. What a life. Anyway I liked Pump better than Sur.  We just have one round then leave and bless my *HUMAN BEING OF A MAN* because he actually said we could go to TomTom! Have I mentioned how long our Thanksgiving was? I earned that shit.

It's two doors down and I walk in and there's a photo back drop thing set up and I'm like oh okay I guess that's just how they do it here, always ready for a photo op. I walk in and KEN IS STANDING RIGHT THERE. I only peed a little. I give my bf that look like ""bitch you better understand you're in the presence of greatness"" and he points out a little sign next to the photo thing. Turns out there's MFING EVENT THAT DAY AND HER MAJESTY LVP IS GOING TO BE THERE AT 4 PM. Do you know what time it was. It was 3 effing 55. I had legitimately just totally stumbled upon this. Anyway the event explains why I was ignored by the bartender (who had beautiful eyes) for a ridiculously long time, turns out he was catering to the people hosting the even and was getting ready for LVP to arrive. I suppose that's okay. Eventually my bf orders a French 75 and this guy actually knew what it was, so good for him. My bf is a bartender and he said that these guys were actually really talented and knew what they were doing. Flips and shit. Kewl. Anyway this woman sits down next to us and says OH HI KEN and Ken comes over and they chat (turns out she's a publicist or something) and she bitches about how she wasn't told if there's a media tab at the bar and Ken's like ""just order a bloody drink someone will pay for it if they don't it will end up being me"" and looks at me and right on cue I laughed way too hard. GOOD ONE KEN! Anyway they chat and then she arrives. She's stunning in person. I said that probably 17 times to my boyfriend but she is truly stunning in real life. She honestly was only there for like 30-45 minutes and took some pictures and did an interview and then is about to head out. I didn't take a picture because I'm not into that kind of photo vibe it's just awkward to me. But my new publicist friend who had been telling me all about he history of WeHo says NOO YOU GOTTA GO GET ONE BEFORE SHE LEAVES?! And I'm like eeeeh should I? to my bf (he says ""why don't you ask her why she isn't filming with the cast?"" Have I mentioned I love him?) and she yanks me up and drags me over and forcefully interrupts them and she's like ""LISA THIS GIRL CAME FROM MAINE SHE NEEDS A PICTURE"" And I look at LVP like ""sorry"" and her and Ken take a pic with me while simultaneously talking about their dinner plans. I'm like ""sorry to bother you"" because I was very much bothering them and she's just like ""oh no dahling my pleasure"" and I peed a little more. Anyway then they left and the publicist was like LET ME SEE THE PIC! YOU HAVE TO POST IT AND TAG ME! I will do none of that but I obviously was talking to my bf about how I was going to tell all of you about it. I'm at work and just wasted a lot of time so I gotta stop for now but I just had to tel you how kewl it was to randomly stumble upon an LVP event in the wild!",1

"New Bravo Show ""Unanchored"" - Let's Discuss  Bravo is introducing us to Unanchored, a series following several 30-something couples taking the trip of a lifetime. It's pitched as a ""buy memories, not things"" adventure.....

Let's get real for a minute, It's a 2 week trip. And they are""not buying houses and depleting their bank accounts"".

Listen - I'm all for traveling, and I'm sure this is going to be a baller vacation (especially with Bravo behind them). But WTF (""who the fuck"" in this case) would spend their entire life savings on a 2 week vacation ? This doesn't seem like something that's going to get renewed (anyone remember Tour Group?), so they're unlikely to find fame. So it's really just a one time vacation (to the Caribbean no less).

I understand Bravo is full of people making unwise life decisions, but this is on a different level. Is anyone actually interested in watching this show? *Let's be honest, I'll still probably watch it.*",1

"Bravo housewives and their young kids I'm actually a little more than tired of people (housewives and fans) acting all bent out of shape when the Housewive kids get dragged into these things like the recent Kelly/Vicki dust up.  Actually pretty damn sick of it.

What planet are we on that we think there would be any way to protect children from any of this crap (and fallout from such crap) that happens on these shows? Ever. Their mothers willingly chose, and therefore forced their whole families, to be on REALITY TV - these kids will be subjected to the opinions of the public, their friends, and their schools and there is no way to control that except to not be on the show at all.  

These housewives are the only ones fully responsible for putting their young kids in the spotlight as well as subjecting them to social stigmas based on their actions on the show.  Whether you are being accused of doing coke or being the one accusing someone of doing it, you are hurting kids - opening them up to social ridicule that their parents are broken or bad or setting an example for your kids that it is okay to talk about people in that matter on TV.

Adult children are a different thing - they are somewhat able to control their involvement, but no such luck if the kid is a minor.

I think Tamra's kid is the only sane one - she knew to get the hell away from the whole thing - and the fact Tamra can't handle that shows how responsible a parent she really is.  The. Worst.

So spare me the 'oh don't involve the kids' hypocritical behavior.  Everyone knows how reality TV works. 

(If we lived in a decent world, these shows wouldn't exist.  But if we lived in a halfway decent world, Vicki would, for once, make a sincere apology, profusely expounding on how she didn't think how her accusations could hurt children, and Kelly leave the show, realizing it isn't good for her kid.)

Yes, I got up on the grumpy side of the bed this morning.  But I've never like kids on reality TV - it is a shitty thing to do to a young person.",1

"Flipping Out and the Seven Stages of Grief I just caught a clip of Jeff's radio show  after the pile-on of the finale last week. Leah Black is on it,with her post mortem cackling, saying Jenny came to her house for hours and she tried and tried to talk her out of going to Bravo. So now we know Jenni DID go to Bravo, after denying it everywhere, including on WWHL.

Next questionable item is that Jeff says to Leah that he hadn't decided on whether to fire Jenny until just before the last meeting, shown on the finale. He says as he was driving there, he got a call from Bravo producers asking about Jenni's allegation of abuse. He said the call was the deciding factor in severing the working relationship totally. (Which makes sense, she was definitely bowled over on camera.) The thing is, after admitting it was the call from Bravo that caused him to decide to offload Jenni, couldn't she sue Jeff? Isn't it illegal in the workplace to fire someone for making a work-related complaint? Also does anyone else think Leah Black was more of a hindrance than a help?

Leah Black tries to explain her ""true"" intentions of ""heeeeelping Jeff aaaaand Jenni"", making it about her at the end. Jeff reveals he and Gage almost broke up, but due to Leah's making him a better communicator, he behaved in a new way and salvaged his relationship w/Gage. Said he's in the seventh stage of grief over Jenni, i.e. Acceptance.",1

"I've run out of housewives to watch so now I'm onto VPR! and OMG! I know very little about it.  Stassi seems like a massive bitch. She basically assaults her friend at her birthday party and thinks she is the victim in the whole thing. She does a bit to camera about how she invites her real friends to Vegas first so they can get the time off and then she asks the people she doesn't really like when she knows they cant get the time off.  Cut to a bunch of extras asking Lisa for time off. They get told no. Stassi falls out with her real friends and then tags along with the people she invited but doesn't really like and tells them theyre all really special friends. Fake friend much?

"Fucking Chandler! Ok, I know I'm probably not saying anything new here from what's already been said in previous posts. But, hey, we love to discuss these shows right? And I'm a few drinks in and I'm watching the latest BD (unfortunately I can't get it real-time) and holy crap. This episode. Am I right? I watched it last night too but honestly it deserved a re-watch.

I think this might me the most fired up I've been about an episode of any of my shows since, IDK, Scary Island maybe? This is an instant classic.

And I gotta say, even though I disliked Chandler I wasn't ready to say he was a sexist pig, misogynist, etc based on his dislike of one person (Rylee - who I also disliked at the start). A shitty person? Sure. A horrible boss? Obviously. Disrespectful? Check. But excuse me, did you just call Kate a glorified housekeeper?  Who is this piece of shit?

And I've rarely been more satisfied with any episode and by that I mean Kate tearing Chandler a new asshole. Taking away his ice cream like a child. And don't get me started on him saying Kate was disrespecting him. Ironic much?

Also, I adore Ashton. And Ross. And Josiah. And of course, Kate but that goes without saying. And don't get me started about Captain Lee who is obviously the best.

"MJ and Reza are high school mean girls Watching the Reunion RN, and, not to plagiarize from Alex McCord, but I can't believe Shahs makes MJ and Reza seem redeemable. I've watched them from beginning and they always have been backstabbing and shit stirrers.

GG is not perfect. She's said a lot of shit. She's obviously unstable. But she's never been given the benefit of the doubt. Her storyline of having RA was made out to be fake, no one blinked twice when she admitted she basically has been deaf her whole life. She got gaslit about saying Mike wanted to have sex with her in Turkey.

Asa- who obviously was annoyingly spiritual- still at least wanted to be normal, found a guy she really was in love with, and had a baby. Yet, MJ and Reza (if you watch it back) went on a smear campaign against her, trying to prove that she had used invitro- which is a very sensitive issue to admit on camera- or implied she was not ""moral"" because she didn't immediately marry her husband when she got pregnant. 

It's been too long since the seasons of Lilly G, but I remember her being pretty strong, independent woman who got bullied by MJ on the show.

Anyways. Am I biased? Am I putting too much thought into a reality tv show? I think maybe I'm starting to grow old of all the ""we're a family"" dynamics. What's your thoughts?",1

"What would you like to see on an ""Unreal"" version of Real Housewives? For those that don't know, Unreal is a scripted tv show that is based around the behind the scenes production of a fictional Bachelor style reality show. It's very dark and messed up, but its absolutely fascinating as well, covering things like the producers plying the contestants with alcohol causing one of them to get raped, as well as 'accidentally' pushing a mentally unstable contestant to suicide by messing with her medication, and bringing her abusive ex-husband on the show. Sorry for the spoilers?

It's basically all about the ways in which the producers manipulate the contestants and the show and work to get the storylines they want played out to play out. Some of the contestants being victims, while others are more complicit.

Im not a fan of the Bachelor, but I would LOVE a Real Housewives version of this show.

An idea that comes to mind that I'd love to see is some sort of lesbian love affair/break up that we see play out off camera, but on camera the two Housewives are having a completely made up fake fight. I guess sort of inspired by Bethenny/Carole? And also the whole argument between Teresa and Jacqueline that was really about Teresa stealing endorsement deals from Jacqueline?

Which housewives would you like to see inspiration taken from? Or what....archetype of housewife?",1
"LVP reportedly has to film one more scene: maybe it's a group scene? [https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/11/17/lisa-vanderpump-dreading-film-rhobh-scene-obligated/](https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/11/17/lisa-vanderpump-dreading-film-rhobh-scene-obligated/)

This was put out there a few days ago. It seems that filming is most likely winding down as they have already done a few trips and have been filming for a few months. I hope that she is being forced to fess up to the group. 

**DORIT:** Will cry uncontrollably because Lisa tried to throw her under the bus by selling stories about her  
**KYLE:** She'll try to stress how she was hurt by Ken's attacks and call her Bobby Fischer again  
**TEDDI:** Will back up Kyle because they are now besties  
**ERIKA:** She'll say her piece about fulfilling work obligations and then just stare daggers  
**RINNA:** She'll roll her eyes watching Kyle/LVP and then explode at the end saying she's OVER IT  
**DENISE:** Will say nothing  
**CAMILLE:** Will stand up at the end and storm out, telling Lisa... ""that's not cool"" 

Given that they don't break the fourth wall, LVP already has an advantage because they can't really call her out on ""doing her job"". I just wish the producers just fucking break the fourth wall and stop kissing Vanderpump's ass. Alex Baskin, one of the producers of the show, was at her dog gala. I raised my eyebrows at that.

"RHONY Seasons 1-3 Jill &amp; Luanne Just binged seasons 1 - 3 again and was taken aback by how shitty Jill and Luanne's behavior was.

Jill learned nothing from her fight with Bethenny. She claimed she was trying to make amends, stop holding grudges, etc. But it was all lies.

&amp;#x200B;

Luanne was SO condescending and holier-than-thou at every turn. She had to scold the women and ""educate"" them on etiquette and manners. She was Jill's lap dog even more in season 3 - Ramona was right that Jill loves the underdogs. Luanne is freshly divorced and ""needs"" Jill to a degree. And Luanne was constantly talking shit behind backs then chastising the other women for doing the same.

Kate wouldn't be in the room if he was firing Chandler, so she thinks it's Caroline. Maybe he fires Caroline but demotes Chandler?

What does everyone else think? I know it's dumb analyzing this but BD has been so good this season and they are really messing with the audience. At one point they were focusing on Rhylee too. At first I didn't like her, but I think it's the edits and she's grown on me.",1

"Fav and Least Fav OC Housewife this season? Now that the season is over who was your fav and least fav this season in OC?

Most Fav- I have to admit I really was impressed with Kelly this season. The bitch is hot, she‚Äôs got great style, she‚Äôs witty and sarcastic, which is (similar to my own sense of humor), funny and smart and owns up to her shit. I think really the worst trait on her is when she becomes a drunk angry mess and starts just spewing the most hurtful things, which luckily we haven‚Äôt had to see this season. I hope that means she‚Äôs truly working on herself. (I get it, I‚Äôm a work in progress too.)

Least Fav: Gina. I can‚Äôt stand that she shit stirs and then denies everything. The whole divorce situation was just so obvious and yet she can‚Äôt even own that. She comes off very fake to me. Also I hate that she can‚Äôt control her kids.

"Below Deck is my current fav. What makes a great show for you? I think BD is unique from other shows and is currently my favourite and I'll attempt to explain why. First, there's real drama (seriously, people's lives depend on these people knowing what they're doing). And this is combined with some serious lifestyle porn and travel porn.

I think things are kept interesting and fresh by having new charter guests every other episode. And further to this, with most seasons the favourites are kept around while at the same time we are injected with new blood with the other yachties.

Outside of BD, I just find having interesting characters and personalities make or break a show. I just love Kate and Josiah. Also, Captain Lee. Also,  Ross and Ashton. Also, the chef. Ok, so I'm really loving BD. But to this point, characters like Ramona, Luann, etc, really make or break a show for me.

And did I mention humour? I love to laugh at these shows and RHONY really shines in that regard. Also, Potomac is pretty amazingly funny.

"I Do The Dubrow Diet! Phase 1 aka ‚ÄòRed Carpet Ready‚Äô aka The First Circle of Hell Hiya! So, it‚Äôs been 5 days and I finally finished Phase 1 of The Dubrow Diet. I‚Äôve regained my sight and dexterity in my thumbs so I thought this was the perfect time to write an update. I have taken ‚Äòbefore‚Äô pictures and was torn about posting them now. I thought it might be better to do a proper before/after at the end of all this for extra added pizzazz! 

Starting weight: 191.4 on a trusted scale that I can only weigh myself once a week so as not to become number obsessed. 

Phase 1. It‚Äôs Christian name is ‚ÄúPhase 1: Red Carpet Ready‚Äù in the book. The carpet I appear on the most is the one you wipe your feet on directly behind the sliding doors at my local Jewel-Osco, so get ready Grocery Baggers, there‚Äôs a new beauty about to be unleashed in the frozen pizza isle. Phase 1 consist of (to be fair, this whole diet is based on) interval eating/fasting. This part is the most extreme/hardest. It‚Äôs an 8/16 schedule, which means you have 8 hours of refueling (a fancy way to say eating) and 16 hours of fasting (which is a fancy way to say rage cleaning). During the 8 hours that you are allowed to think about food, you may eat only two meals and a snack. Buckle your seatbelts, because The meals are barely meals and the snack is legit hysterical. I will have you know, I followed it exactly and have not wavered, except for one small thing that I‚Äôll cover in a sec. 

The Dubrow‚Äôs do not like carbohydrates. I would not be a bit surprised if a delinquent carbohydrate drove a croissant truck over Terry‚Äôs favorite grandparent. There is not a potato to be seen on this menu. Rice, no dice. Here is what I ate and when I ate it. (Again, this is EXACTLY from the book. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúHeather‚Äôs Sample Diet‚Äù or somesuch). 


Sigh...
11am: (you are correct-this is the first meal of your day) 4oz of protein 2 one half cup servings of vegetables (that are basically either green or cauliflower) and you get 1 complex carb but it‚Äôs awful. It‚Äôs black beans or edamame-like that. So my go-to was 2oz turkey breast, egg white omelette with spinach, asparagus and black beans. Couldn‚Äôt you just die!

3pm: SNACK! Heather recommends deli sliced turkey breast and fresh cut vegetables or, if in the go ‚Äúlike her‚Äù you can (this is really what she said) ‚Äústop and take the meat out of a gas station sandwich‚Äù. This is an onion: I want you to picture Heather Dubrow in a gas station. I want you to picture Heather Dubrow buying food in a gas station. I want you to picture Heather Dubrow squirreling through that food like a raccoon at midnight, discarding the undesired portions and then being so wealthy that she advises people in a book she writes to, in kind, buy AND throw food away. 

7pm: Last meal of the day! The Fuck?!?! Same as the first: 4oz of protein and 2 half cup servings of Horror vegetables. I‚Äôd do chicken breast and green beans and cauliflower. If you had your carb in the first meal, you cannot have another. You get one per day. ONE. 

7:05pm: Go to your guest bathroom and scream into the folded towels because you‚Äôre done bitch. 

Now it‚Äôs 16 hours before you‚Äôll eat again. This allows your body to lower glucose levels and your mind to come up with new ways to murder slow drivers. 

You are only allowed to do this for 5 days max, though, I have a sneaking suspicion this is how the Dubrow‚Äôs eat on the regular. But honestly, how do I feel, you might be asking? On this end of it, I feel great: OF COURSE I wish I was knee deep in a pie factory but, I can tell a difference in my energy level and I am 100% sure I‚Äôve gotten more vegetables in my mouth in the last 5 days than the last three months combined. Day two, I would‚Äôve pushed my children into a burning pile of leaves for a scone, but I didn‚Äôt (because no one would ever really reward me with a scone for doing that). I had a sex dream but instead of having sex, I was buttering a bagel. I do think I look leaner-especially my face. The hardest part is not eating first thing in the morning. It goes against everything I‚Äôve ever known about health. I have a 6yr old that will tell you that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. The Dubrow‚Äôs say this is not only untrue, but it is a social construct and a marketing ploy. 

Speaking of marketing ploys: there is an outside chance that this book is one big advertisement for The badly named Beaut√© line of products the Dubrow‚Äôs have. They both wake up at 6 am (as do I) and drink Beaut√© Primo Beet and Primo Greens (35 calories in all). Ive already bought the book and Heaven knows they have enough money. They will get no more from me. How many Embryo Windows could one family need?!?! So, this is the only part I diverge from. I wake up and take an Emergen-C and a scoop of low cal fiber. The whole thing is 35 calories and I‚Äôm at peace with this decision. 

Finally, they‚Äôre big on coffee. Hungry in the morning? Drink coffee!!!! Hungry after lunch?? Coffee!!! They call is an anorectic and will help decrease hunger, I say it will cause nothing but bathroom heartache but if you‚Äôve got nowhere to go and love irregular palpitations, drink up! Heather recommends having a coffee caddy around at all times, which is what I can only assume is what rich people call baristas. She uses non dairy creamer. I use unsweetened cashew milk, (like a drop) and her and I both use stevia (Stars ARE just like us!). She does NOT advocate using other artificial sweeteners or diet drinks. 

So there we are. That‚Äôs my first 5 days. Phase 1 complete. I will weigh myself on Sunday and tomorrow is day 1 of ‚ÄúPhase 2 Summer is Coming‚Äù. AMA. Hugs you guys!!!


Edit: Whaaat!!!! Thank you all SO much! I‚Äôm feeling a lot of love-this sub is the best. Period. ",1

"What IRL dream plots would you like to see on RHOBH? We've talked about it a little bit but even beyond the CDAN/BlindGossip stuff there's plenty about the Housewives going on in real life. (Though I would kill to know whether that blind about Kim and the shotgun is real.)

What would you want them to actually deal with?

I'd love to see:

* Kyle trying to handle her beloved project about her mother being cancelled.

* Since Kim brought it up on Marriage Bootcamp maybe a little about the darker side of child acting.

* Kyle and Mauricio dealing with the lawsuit

* Erika and her actual relationship with Tom plus maybe some more juice than her book offered because according to Heather McDonald it was a snore.

* Teddi talking more about how her Dad's many relationships effected her emotionally.

* PEEKAY and Dorit and their fake ass lifestyle including the huge lawsuit from the Bellagio plus the allegations they walled out one of their business partners for Dorit's paint by numbers swimsuits. If they could get footage of that amazing Instagram confrontation by that British model I would be delighted.

* SO MUCH TALKING about Denise's family situation.

* Kind of an overview of Lisa's grief. I don't want it to get too real but just some talking about how suicide can devastate families.

* Since they're still filming during the fires, Camille's situation with evacuation and maybe something about how those Ferraris were rescued.

* Honestly just like lots about them being dumb and rich too. 

And I'm not talking about up and close Kim style voyeurism, just an acknowledgement this very real shit is going on around them.

Honorable mention:

* Less of Rinna's daughters and more about HarryHamlin hiking alone

* Also god I am desperate for someone to actually talking about yachting. Come on Rinna.",1

"I prefer Ramona so much more without Mario Hey all, I listen to some housewives podcasts and many are saying there‚Äôs a chance Mario and Ramona are back together.

She was my least favourite housewife and now I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs in my top 3 (in terms of just being comic relief and *so* watchable).

When she was with Mario, she was judgmental and holier than thou. She never got off her high horse or owned up to her wrong doings. 

Do you remember when her and Mario double teamed Heather in Season 5 and essentially pushed her into a corner saying she has a habit of talking over people? Heather was a guest in their home. It was brutal to see and might I add, ‚ÄúDE-CLASSAY.‚Äù

She‚Äôs so much more fun as single Ramona and I find her to be far more relatable.

If anyone does send it to me because there are discussions for every other one! 

EITHER WAY, I thought let‚Äôs talk about it here! Years later! Do you guys remember how fucking crazy this episode was? I personally love Eileen and I think she was a wonderful host given all the Brandi, Kim, Kyle drama. 

I also personally love this season because I love hate watching people and brandis downfall is amazing. She was abhorrent in this episode, calling everyone stupid and pushing Kyle. But I wonder if there was any truth to her saying that Kyle is only there for Kim on camera and that she called Kyle when she was worried about Kim but Kyle said it‚Äôs none of her business. I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to live with an addict so maybe even if Kyle said that it‚Äôs valid. What do you guys think?

Also I love Lisa Rinna but I wonder if it was fucked up for her to ask Kim if she was sober in the limo, even jokingly. Either way she didn‚Äôt deserve to be subjected to any of Kim‚Äôs ridiculousness but I wonder if that was the trigger that kicked off some of the night. ",1
"Rewatching RHONY - Kelly Bensimon Question Apologizes for how this looks, I‚Äôm on mobile. 

I‚Äôm currently rewatching New York and I‚Äôm on the 100th Episode, Season 7, Episode 24. I‚Äôve seen Kelly say this in the past, and she just repeated it (regarding Bethenny ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù her reputation on the Scary Island episodes), that she is a single mother and the only income for her children. Gilles Bensimon is still alive, is he not involved in the children‚Äôs lives at all? Does he pay no child support? 


How can a Kelly claim to be a truly single mother, no help, no support, when her ex-husband is clearly still around and presumably part of their children‚Äôs lives? 

Is this just ‚ÄúKelly-talk‚Äù or true, does anyone know the scoop?",1
"Predictions for Season 7 of VPR? Alright everyone, with season 7 of VPR premiering in a couple of weeks...it's time to make our predictions of what will happen this season! Obviously we know that a couple of people get engaged, and Tom Tom has opened. 

* **Scheana -** Showed her true colors last season. Are we in for another season of soul-sucking narcissism? Do you think that the majority of the cast kind of hates her (again)? 
* **Jax** \- Claims to have changed. More coked-out rampages? 
* **Tom Sandoval** \- Weirdly awful last season, and made terrible calls. Main storyline will probably again be about Tom Tom. Will probably try to make Ariana reconsider marriage, because two of his close friends get engaged. 
* **Tom Schwartz -** Seemed to have a better relationship with Katie last season. Will also probably have Tom Tom as his main storyline...unless the producers finally address his alcohol problem. 
* **Katie** \- Was admittedly pretty awesome last season...but could it have been a ""redemption tour""? I'm erring on the side that she was relatively genuine, between the marijuana card and ""finally feeling like herself again"" after her skylight incident many years ago. 
* **Stassi** \- Has a new man! What will come of this? 
* **Ariana** \- More talk about body image, sex, jealousy of Tom not spending enough time with her...? We know Ariana is now a member of the Witches of WeHo, though! 
* **Brittany** \- I have nothing. She's sweet but she knew exactly what she was getting into with Jax. It'll probably be another season that revolves around her planning wedding stuff (I expect that the wedding will be shown on Jax and Brittany take Kentucky?). 
* **James** \- Lol. Will probably be hilarious again this season. Will probably display some sort of jealousy over Lala getting engaged to Randall (meaning that she's nearly sealed the deal with him). Raquel drama? 
* **Lala** \- Has some great moments, and also has some insufferable ones. Will probably get too cocky and will need to be knocked down a few pegs. Might try to act like the queen bee, but will start to be condescending. 
* **Kristen** \- Will probably meddle in things that she has no reason to. Carter drama?
* Billie Lee? :/ I have a feeling she'll be in this season quite frequently. ",1

Bleh.

Come on Andy.  Even I can do this.  When is the last time you got a paycheck from Jeff Lewis Design? When is the last time you talked to Jeff?  Do you miss Jeff and Gage?  If you didn't file a claim, did you complain about him?  -or, if that's too risky- What's your biggest complaint from working with Jeff over the last few years?  What did the cameras not catch, because it seems like you two were getting along on the show?  Especially - what are the chances you and Jeff might become friends again?  OR what would you say to him in an elevator?

Etc. Between this and Emily casting off her judgement of Shannon's mental health as ""not malicious"" and her husband is a good husband because he's ""the best dad"" - UGHHHH!!

I was going to do it anyway, because I have been stress eating like champ and, well, I do have fashions to fit in by Christmas. Also, I‚Äôll be going to my tiny home town and I‚Äôd really like to be‚ÄùFuck You Thin‚Äù whilst popping into the Walmart, just in case I see any old chums...I digress:

Would anyone here be interested in the least if I let the whole thing play out here? Like, ‚ÄúDoes it work‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is it really‚Äù, ‚ÄúAre they literate‚Äù, that stuff. I can post before/during/after pictures in real time. Menus, ER visits etc. I‚Äôm halfway through it now and I‚Äôve already learned I‚Äôm Skinny-fat and will probably die in four days! I‚Äôm already learning so much! 

I can be as detailed as you guys want. (Well, sort of detailed-I have a two month old and a six year old so all this lofty planning is on a foundation made of sand...and diapers. But hey, it‚Äôll be helping me too. I might be more apt to stay true to it if I know I‚Äôm reporting to you guys AND it‚Äôll kind of give us all something to giggle about (they REALLY try to be funny-like Bethenny funny).

She is so damn fake, annoying, gas lighting, condescending, etc that it's making it hard for me to even watch her scenes.  I have never cared for her, but this season it has gotten progressively worse and I'm totally over her.  This crap with D'Andra is so over the top ridiculous, I have to assume she is ""acting"".  There's no way she can be this delusional.  Ugh.  And the fake tears??  And I couldn't believe everyone was by her side consoling her.  WTF?   Also, I find it hard to believe that someone who is so concerned with her image and her family's name (barf) would actually be friends with LeAnne.  LeAnne is not exactly a shining member of high society.  LeAnne's bull shit is really getting on my nerves this season too, but this thread is for my distaste for Kam.  lol

Yes, I am being shady towards LVP here, but I have liked her in the past. However, I find her to be very hypocritical about the dog abuse during the Yulin festival when there are similarly horrific animal abuse going on in the meat and dairy industry. I'm not trying to say one is good or one is bad or anything like that. I just find it to be a little hypocritical that she is so outspoken about dog abuse but not farm animals/livestock.

To my knowledge she is not vegetarian, but I'd like to know if anyone has heard anything different.

"So I accidentally rode with Emily &amp; Gina to Vegas this weekend Totally by chance, we walked into the jet waiting room and BAM, there was Emily &amp; Gina! At first I was shocked, but I was really just taken aback by how incredibly gorgeous they are in person. Honestly, the TV doesn't do either of them justice. Emily in particular was stunning and I never really thought that when seeing her on screen. We heard them speaking about the reunion and discussing things, heard them drop a few of the ladies names but couldn't fully hear the conversation (sorry guys). They seemed to be talking about filming the reunion for the most part while we were waiting to board and discussing things like ""and then could you believe she said that? I KNOW!"" Then, when we boarded the plane we traded off taking photos in front of the jet and exchanged a few pleasantries about our first time on a jet, which they seemed to be just as giddy about as we were. Gina's accent is actually really cute too, haha. They were extremely sweet and seemed to be having a great time together. Honestly, they felt like fun, humble ladies that you'd actually like to hang out with in real life. Being that we were in a private terminal, I didn't want to be super creepy but I did snag a sweeping shot of them in one of my videos, so I'll add that in the comments when I log into imgur. When we landed, their car was waiting on the tarmac and they were swept away and onto better things.

"Brandi vs. LeeAnne This is my first time posting to the sub, usually I‚Äôm just a lurker but I‚Äôm compelled because I legitimately can‚Äôt stand Brandi from Dallas and I‚Äôm catching up on the most recent episodes. I‚Äôm not a LeeAnne fan by any stretch and not excusing her past behavior but I feel like she‚Äôs getting the short end of the stick in this specific dynamic.

Brandi used LeeAnne last season to hurt Stephanie because she was mad and isn‚Äôt mature enough to communicate with her best friend - which was really low. When she and Stephanie reconciled, she dropped LeeAnne and turned on her. To me, that was horrible, regardless of how LeeAnne has been to others, I think that genuinely hurt her and was really messed up.

This season, Brandi is cozying up with D‚ÄôAndra and when LeeAnne had some legitimate concerns about it in the beginning she is gaslighted and accused of being jealous. I‚Äôm not excusing LeeAnne for alluding to a drinking problem and airing out D‚ÄôAndra‚Äôs business, bc I think that is unacceptable. BUT I think Brandi is completely disingenuous and needs to be called out. I really can‚Äôt stand her. She wants to be the girl next door but she really acts like a snake and a shit stirrer, IMO. Sorry this was long and rambling!

"Teresa and Family/Friend Relationships I was doing an older season rewatch (like I haven't done this already 10 times) and can someone please explain to me why she legit hates Kathy and Rosie and will never let them be a part of her life again? I get it started from Kathy saying her dad was a coward or something at the reunion (where Teresa was also saying some shit about her parents) but is that really the ONLY reason?? Teresa is allowed to do/say whatever she wants, and if you do the same she will hold it against forever as if you crossed the queen or something while never taking ownership in what she did. Kathy is such a good person and it pisses me off Teresa gets away with painting them like the bad people. Also Melissa and Joe had such a fun relationship with Kathy and Richie.. I loved them all together in their first season, such a shame they're not anymore cause everyone needs to obey Teresa.


Brings me to this Danielle question. Does Danielle like have blackmail on Teresa of some sort? Because this friendship is still baffling to me. The fact that Teresa was her maid of honor, and also Teresa speaking out about Danielle's divorce and supporting her friend (as if she didn't just have a 2 second marriage) is weird to me. Not that Jacqueline is my favorite, but she spent her whole season back trying to move forward with Teresa and she would not have it, but Danielle is now practically her family. What gives?!


Teresa 1st season was so great, def one of my faves then. But she really changed.. and I'm extremely confused on these relationships.",1

"Curious on Everyone's Thoughts on RHOC Just interested in hearing everyone opinions on this franchise. There was a lot of talk leading up to the trip that it was gonna be some good dramatic episodes... while I think that was accurate, why did it still not do anything for me? There was drama and funny moments but I was still just meh about it. Maybe it's that I don't feel any connection with the cast. I thought I was into Gina in the beginning, but she kinda bugs me now. And I like Kelly, and know she is a fan favorite but she still can bother me. I think she can be a mean mean girl. And she says dumb things like ""You don't believe in God? I do, and I've gotten everything I wanted that I've prayed for."" That line annoyed me on so many levels. Tamra has just been doing the same selfish shit that she has been for the past 10 years. Same with Vicky.

I've been an avid watcher of all the franchises since the beginning so I'm thinking maybe OC has just run it's course. They are the longest running franchise. And there was a point Ii really enjoyed them, but I think there's just about nothing they can do (with this cast) that'll make me interested to watch. It's truly a chore to watch.

"Watching Aviva Drescher and her husband on Marriage Boot Camp solidified everything I thought about them when they were on RHONY... Aviva is obsessed with being ‚Äúfamous‚Äù while doing as little as possible to actually BE famous and Reid is just her little follower. She didn‚Äôt want to participate during RHONY but wanted all the fame and she did it again on Marriage Boot Camp. 

She is 100% in control of her husband, Reid, which we saw on RHONY. She won‚Äôt even let Reid fully participate in the counseling bc they only went on the show to get more famous. The other couples got so frustrated with them only half participating and eventually called them out on only being there for the paycheck. Heck, even the therapists grew tired of Aviva and Reid refusing to participate fully. Oh and the lie detector in the second to last episode proved Aviva only wanted to come on the show for fame (and apparently wishes she was with her ex who we met on RHONY!). 

I mean, they made Heidi and Spencer look good! I didn‚Äôt think that was possible, to be honest lol. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever hated a Housewife more than Aviva...and I can‚Äôt staaaand Tamra, so that‚Äôs saying a lot! At least all the other hated Housewives worked to earn that hatred but Aviva did as little as possible and she‚Äôs still somehow the worst for me.

So much of Brandi‚Äôs story on RHOBH is wrapped up in her complicated relationship with LVP, but I actually think her push-and-pull with Kyle was even more volatile.

I‚Äôve always wondered why Kyle kept trying to make nice with Brandi time after time, despite their clashes. Granted, their first feud in season 2 was ALL Kyle and Kim‚Äôs fault.

But in later years, I think Kyle did try to give Brandi the benefit of the doubt more, even as Brandi was poisoning the well with Kim. Why do you think Kyle kept trying to keep the peace, whereas she gave up quickly with Carlton and Eden? In the bigger picture, her conflict with Brandi was MUCH more volatile/hurtful.

"Slight Rant I love coming on here and answering questions for y‚Äôall. What I don‚Äôt like is someone using my comments to get likes on IG or twitter. So for now I not going to be responding to messages in here. I don‚Äôt want drama between me and any cast member new or old. Part of the reason I turned down the show last season. For everyone that respected me coming here and answering questions, I have nothing but love. Unfortunately, it takes one person to screw up a good thing.

"Who gets fired on Below Deck? Theories (Spoilers) So I was re-watching the first episode to catch my friend up and noticed two new people not part of the original crew. I do believe when Kate says ""fire her or I quit"" she is referring to Caroline, since there is a new stewardess. I also think Chandler is fired because there is a brief scene where Kate and Captain are looking at Chandler and Captain Lee mentions a personnel shift. I assume this is right after Ashton falls overboard and is rescued by Rhylee. Apologies for the bad quality photos!

"""Bravo's Play By Play"" post-mortem As a total Bravoholic I'm surprised I only just realized that ""Play by Play"" has been cancelled (not officially announced anywhere I can see, but [they haven't aired a new episode since 10/8](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8680646/), though it did get name-checked in [this BravoTV.com article](http://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/shannon-beador-with-tom-sandoval-tom-schwartz-at-tom-tom) about Tom Tom just yesterday so who knows really).

I never watched a whole ep but watched the first five minutes of each episode right after RHOC because I set my DVR to run long. My feelings were that it felt too scripted...wish they went with more of a ""Bitch Sesh"" meets ""The View"" but with dudes, or maybe like [ESPN's ""Around The Horn,""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_Horn) anything with more free-flowing commentary on different Bravo topics. Instead it felt more like state-run media propaganda from Bravo lmao. For me the show didn't feel genuine or authentic, which made it not fun to watch.

Also Jerry McConnell has all of the self-hype and complete unsubtlety of your zaniest local car salesman's commercials. He did no favors for the show as its lead if you ask me.

Did anybody enjoy it and was surprised by its quick death? What do you think could've changed to make it more successful?",1

"""The Bachelorette's"" Rachel Lindsay talks about meeting Ramona Singer DISCLAIMER: IDK IF THIS BELONGS HERE, OR ON ""THE BACHELOR"" SUB (sorta new here)!

I was listening to The Morning Toast (I recap podcasts for r/thebachelor! I'm NOT a fan of the hosts, PUT AWAY THE PITCHFORKS!) and Rachel Lindsay (ABC'S Bachelorette), was a guest. ANYWAYS they randomly started talking Real Housewives S011 around minute 12:30 and Rachel shares a story about meeting Ramona at Fashion Week around 13:30!


https://youtu.be/utr132sYlbI?t=750

Rachel says that Ramona basically just ran up to her and was like ""they told me you're the Bachelorette and I need to take a picture with you"", in the most theatrical way ever. Rachel explains that she was excited, being a RHONY fan herself, but admits that Ramona seemed a bit ""toasted"" (when ISN'T it ~TuRTlE TiiiMe~ ??) lol

So they take a picture and for whatever reason, Ramona takes Rachel's managers' number down. AND THEN, Ramona THINKS she's sending the picture to HER manager, but sends it to RACHEL'S manager, telling them: 

&gt;""LüëÄK!!! it's me and The Bachelorette! Post it everywhere, put it on my social page! MAYBE I COULD BE THE NEXT BACHELORETTE!"" 


Totally believable, totally Ramona. But also, totally bummed this'll never happen. üò≠


Regardless, Rachel's final thoughts were: we've got Colton rn, so why not Ramona next?! G-D HELP US ALL.

Then again i think it's also due to Alex not always expressing herself well when she is upset and Sonya repeating back what happened in a different way than it actually did. I felt like it was mean of her to not let Simon speak when it was clearly very important to him and Alex. What would it really have even hurt? Then rather than hear Alex's side she just starts repeating ""THIS IS MY NIGHT YOU ARE SO RUDE"" and throws Alex out of the party. Which side do you fall on for this particular argument?

"Housewives Making Cameos? &amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/n3m8vvjrnzu11.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

I was binge watching Gossip Girl (I'm sick and I just finished binge-watching RHOM S4 and I needed something to fill the void) and I screamed a little when I saw Tinsley Mortimer's name in the beginning credits of the first episode of the second season, so naturally I took a picture and instinctively wanted to share it on this thread. I mean it makes sense that Tinsley would be on that show since it's about the New York socialite scene -- but still I gasped.

"D‚ÄôAndra vs LeeAnne Before the season started, D‚ÄôAndra was all over Twitter pre-apologizing for what she said would be ‚Äúa rough season‚Äù. We‚Äôre now deep into Dallas, and unless things change really drastically, does anyone else think she apologized prematurely?

I‚Äôm not even saying LeeAnne is being an Uber-villain again. It seems their friendship just went sideways, and they both said things that were equally out of line to start (LeeAnne about the finances, D‚ÄôAndra about separate lives and hostility about the wedding). It was regular Housewives levels of rudeness.

But when LeeAnne brought up drinking (whether it was well-intentioned or not) I think D‚ÄôAndra was totally justified in feeling crushed given her tragic history with her dad. If anyone has been snakey in this feud, I think it has been Brandi trying to pry a wedge between D‚ÄôAndra and LeeAnne at every opportunity.",1

She went from being fairly calm in the early seasons to being someone who made odd side comments constantly and exploding. I‚Äôm not one for mean comments but the whole wacko thing really started to make sense. 

Was it nick‚Äôs diagnosis that caused her breakdown? Or did the loss of her friendship with Teresa really impact her that badly?

Definitely Danielle ,1
Vanes sa is hot mess.,1
dude she was married to Morgan for a hot second and he has refused for years to give her a decent settlement. I'm sure she had fun for a few years but her husband was not a generous man and she's a drunken liar. Your rich-people headcanon is adorable tho,1

I'm the old one. My memory is slipping haha",1
It was my first thought that maybe the girls had a hand in this request. My parents divorced when I was 15. My mom was an amazing woman but the divorce hit her hard. She started relying on wine a little too much and her behavior started becoming erratic. It made me extremely uncomfortable especially because I essentially had to become the mom and take care of my mother. At that age it is really hard to watch your parent spiral. The girls probably confided in their dad and he saw it as an opportunity to stick it to Shannon where it hurts. ,1
remember when Sonja claimed Madonna came to her fashion show but couldn't get in? Truly underrated wtf moment,1

lol really?? wtf,1
Make her full time PUH-LEASE. Release a Wild Jacqueline Laurita on her and add one of Danielle‚Äôs friends (if she has any) and demote Dolores because I can‚Äôt anymore with her,1
Right as Lisa comes back to film and probably get confronted by the ladies someone smashes a production truck behind Sur literally during filming. Lol. ,1
She's just making her money moves. ,1
But about what? She was clearly reacting to something Caroline had said/done.,1
"I just watched S7E1... god, I forgot how awful everyone on this show is. Ariana is the only one I don't find completely insufferable, but she's still like 80% annoying. ",1
"Oh but Eddie is two faced about it - behind her back he's happy to tear her down, but to her face he's just an empty smile.

Given a choice between the two, I'd rather hear Shane tell me he hates me than have Eddie act like we're friends.",1

"WHAT?!?!?!?!??! I felt the COMPLETE opposite.

The movie fucked up by ""wrapping things up nicely"". The book was great because they were like ""yupp, we're still going""

She‚Äôs not fat by any means, but she‚Äôs been carrying this extra weight for a few seasons now.

"Well, that's fucking disgusting.",1
"I think he raised the issue to the court because he is both a controlling dick AND a concerned father.  

He could have easily resolved his concerns privately, asking her attorney for a reciprocal agreement, binding on both of them, to remain sober while the girls are in their respective custody.    Give Shannon a chance to agree and comply, sparing everyone the humiliation and labels,  before putting it out there for the press to pick up.  Privacy would have helped the girls.  This is an embarrassing issue for them.   Putting this issue into the public record was a dick move.  ",1

Omg I just rewatched some early S4 eps the other day and completely forgot how into each other Carlton and her nanny were!! I totally believe it.,1
"Totally agreed! I trust my SO completely, but I would shut that down real quick. Just because it was disrespectful.",1
"Exactly.   It is impossible to know if Shannon is an addict.  But anyone that watches, objectively, has to admit that she abuses alcohol.  When it comes to children, that's a problem.  

And Shannon admitted to using alcohol to cope didn't she?  That's per se, abuse.  Her own ""friends"" sat on camera, multiple times and recounted Shannon telling them about drinking herself to sleep nightly, drinking straight vodka alone in the middle of the night, etc.    

Alcohol abuse has been a constant theme for Shannon since her first season.  I have never understood why anyone who hasn't a problem, would continue to drink on camera given the scrutiny.  And with a divorce pending, and an ass like David looking for any way to gain leverage?  You couldn't pay me to get drunk with a Bravo camera present.  And like you said, she was wasted in Mexico, and said she blacked out.

"Their old money makes your old money look like a drop in the ocean- no offense (or maybe you're a Rockerfeller or Vanderbilt slumming it on Reddit- weirder things have happened)  they bought and paid everyone they needed to keep their secrets and their stature. You know why she hasn't published a memoir? Her ex likely paid her to keep her mouth shut, I think she is more filtered than she lets on. I don't think it's unrealistic to think that JFK Jr, who was a young wealthy, famous, bachelor in the 80s, partied. New York was rampant with blow, booze, parties, money- you're telling me a 20 something rich kid didn't party? Ha- he just never got caught. And Sonja hung in those circles. ",1

I want to know WHO SAID THAT? (And yes I know we already know. It‚Äôs a joke.),1
"That's an easy answer, 1000% yes they did. No reason for anyone to make it up, the only person really denying it was brittney and she was CLEARLY lying every time she denied it. She's a southern girl and her family would not approve, no way she could allow memaw and paw paw to watch her on national television talking about fucking another girl. Happens all the time in the south, people be gay af but deny deny deny bc of family/friend groups.   

Kristen pretended to deny it as a favor to brittney. She gains nothing from being truthful and was just doing a solid for her best ever girlfriend/love of her life.  

The real question here, why is kristen SO obsessed with brittney? The way she flew her mom out, the way she talks to her and about her, the way she's always touching and holding her...i wanna know if the hookup was really just a super drunken sexscapade, or if those two have something going on on the side.  

Edit: to clarify on my first point about no reason to make it up-it only created a super weak side storyline. I don't believe anyone lied about it happening in the first place simply to create a storyline. For me, the truth was written ALL. OVER. Brittneys face every time she denied it. Girl is a *really* bad liar. ",1

Contrary to popular American belief drinking to the point of blacking out is....pretty bad. Especially if you're her age. I feel like there are many many many more examples of her being shit-faced on the show...

&amp;#x200B;

Edited to say that I do not think she is an alcoholic. However she has exhibited behavior on TV that indicates that she doesn't have a great relationship with alcohol and doesn't always know how to control her alcohol intake. ",1

It was the first one I watched! I liked it a lot. Then after i finished binging it I watched RHONY. i remember it was nothing like RHOC. The first season was so boring and I wasn't invested in the characters enough to care. But I kept at it and was like thank goodness I did cause it was sooooo freaking good. Then I watched the first season of Atlanta and I didn't like it but everyone says its amazing. I'm going to try and give the second season a chance cause I've been told its the best of the franchise.,1
TOTALLY,1
I want my pink shirt back!,1
Um yummmmm. If you could please send some my way (the dinner not the wine) I would love that. Thank you!!!,1
One day soon I will get around to watching OC! ,1
OC did it at each other's houses. The first season Jeana had a barbecue or end of the summer party or something like that for all her neighbors. This was when they talked about how exclusive it was living inside the gates and they were all from coto and it was coto this and coto that. ,1

"There have only been six episodes so far. Is it gonna be a shorter season? I kind of hope so. I think shorter seasons lead to more drama in each episode.

Also, I‚Äôm loving this season so far. Jackie is a trouble maker and is calling Teresa out. Danielle is in her shit-stirring prime. The Melissa/Teresa drama feels real-ish. Jennifer is a joke and has great housewife potential. And Margaret vs Danielle is obviously staged, but so good! The only person not bringing it is Dolores and boy is she trying with the Frank shit.

I posted about it here when it happened but I was at the same hotel  in Mexico as Dina and her boyfriend last February. It was not a huge place and I saw them several times and sat near them at the pool one day. He is so insanely obnoxious and loud. There was a strict no phone rule at the pool (it was the adults only one so no kids screaming either) and he was making loud business calls over and over and disrupting everyone around him. He also went and bought Dina something in the gift shop or something and was basically shouting at her about it because he wanted everyone to hear it was expensive and one of a kind. All of this to say...I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Caroline doesn‚Äôt like him for other reasons. ,1

$5600 was my quoted price for two years. I only paid half because I only had it for a year.

I wasn't expecting to have the attachments glued to my teeth in order to help the trays move my teeth, so I felt awkward whenever I took my trays out because people always thought I had white bits of food on my teeth.

The Invisalign did close the gap I had between my two front teeth, but other than that, it didn't do much for me. I was disappointed, but the orthodontist had been pretty upfront about his concern that it might not work for me. 

I did 6 months of metal braces to get the rest of my teeth straightened out.

My take is that if you have minor things you need to get straight, it should definitely work! ",1

"It was definitely LVP, however, these are the storylines that annoy me most. I hate when they bring up what happened behind the camera. Yes, LVP came up with the magazines. Yes, LVP came up with Munchausen. No, don't want to hear about your discussions behind the camera.

Every housewife has behind the scene discussions regarding storylines, but LVP gets called on it every season. At this point, I think it's obvious that LVP isn't the master manipulator that she tries so hard to be. She has no friends and is consistently outed by the rest of the cast for doing the same thing that everyone else does. I actually think Kyle is the most manipulative of that group, because she never gets caught. She's been gunning for LVP ever since season 2, but masks it as if she a truly caring friend. 

The other thing that annoys me about the Munchausen storyline was that LVP was kind of right. Chronic Lyme disease is not considered a real disease by any reputable physician. I hated that the season ended with everyone apologizing for doubting Yolanda's fake illness. 

I'm not an LVP defender. I'm ready for her to leave the show, but I hate that Kyle will outlast her.",1

Also the scene of them in the back of a car and she's looking through the trash and something hinky was happening but they never explicitly stated what. 

Something about that relationship, but particularly that episode, was waaaay dark to me. I guess my question would be: what were they on? What was in the limo trash that Ken so urgently didn't want shown on camera? ",1

"I read in the Vogue article that these days, any work they do is really for show and good publicity for the restaurant... so they show up, shmooze, and serve a few drinks, but they don't actually serve or bartend anymore. And that at this point, having them actually work a shift would be a bit of a liability because of fan's expectations of them. Exception: Peter, who is definitely a manager and fulltime employee.

[Edit](https://www.vogue.com/projects/13547011/babes-in-pump-land-vanderpump-rules-bravo/), about a third of the way down:  

&gt;And in its upcoming season, the *Vanderpump* cast will finally be able to shed at least one production constriction: They will be allowed to stop working at SUR, or, at least, to work less. Much of that is because the Toms, Schwartz and Sandoval, went into business last season with Lisa and her husband, Ken Todd, on their latest restaurant, TomTom, so they are now, instead of bartenders, minority owners, at a 5 percent stake.  
&gt;  
&gt;And it‚Äôs partially because actually serving food has become too difficult with the notoriety of the show; now, it is only feasible for the cast to moonlight at SUR and Pump, another restaurant, opened in 2014, to greet fans, and run a few drinks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mostly like hosting,‚Äù Brittany described. She and Katie are still technically on staff; the next day, they would have to wear the old SUR uniform, a translucent paisley-printed scarf, essentially, worn as a halter dress. ‚ÄúYou bust your ass as a waitress so you don‚Äôt have to waitress anymore,‚Äù Katie said, ‚Äúbut now I‚Äôm forever a waitress.‚Äù

I miss when the parties were a family thing. Everyone brought their kids with them. It was like a cast party and they filmed part of it. I think now there's too much drama to bring the kids. Typically the party is the last chance for them to dish everything out from the season before the reunion. They tend to want it to be super dramatic so everyone goes into the reunion pissed. I can see how its not kid friendly anymore. But they used to all gather around and the kids were even friends. It was cute.,1

I had a short treatment (8 months) and it was mainly to fix a spacing issue that popped up in the back a few years after the loss of my wisdom teeth.  I also had a crossbite, so I had elastics included in my treatment.  Overall, it was painless and my teeth look really nice still (even though I don't wear my retainer as much as I should!).  Check out /r/Invisalign too (because there really is a subreddit for *everything*)!

I think she probably was drinking more to combat the stress of the crumbling marriage, but a period of problematic use does not make someone an alcoholic, and you're hardly qualified to be attributing that label to her. There are many housewives who I think have problematic alcohol use (Dorinda), but I would never stoop so low to make a statement like the one you made. 

The girls seem like they're kind of playing both their parents in the divorce. It's a typical tactic for teenagers. I remember reading an article last year that the girls weren't talking to David. They're teen girls going through a lot of changes; things are bound to be rocky with their parents.

I can't think of a better word to describe consistent pattern of lies intended to keep up a facade of a relationship he wasn't invested in so Scheana defended him cheating. At that point he should have just said hey I'm not as into this as you are not pit her against her friends to the point it started to cause major rifts which havent recovered. She truly questioned the reality of the fact they cared enough for her to tell her she was being humiliated and lied too. 

You can say manipulation or lies but it still feels like gaslighting to get someone and trick them into thinking a loving relationship feels like this when your actions say otherwise. ",1
"**LET ME SAVE YOU A CLICK**

&gt; The divorce battle between the Real Housewives of Orange County's Shannon Beador and her estranged husband of 17 years, David, raged on Tuesday after he requested an order to prevent her from consuming alcohol around their three teenage daughters.

--

&gt; If granted by the OC Superior Court judge next month, the 54-year-old reality star would be prohibited from drinking eight hours before or during her time with Sophie, 16; and twins Adeline &amp; Stella, 14 - according to The Blast.

--

&gt; 'The mother had publicly stated on television within the last month, she ""self-medicates"" with alcohol. That behavior is detrimental to the children,' the 53-year-old businessman's legal docs stated.  

--

&gt; The Beador Construction Inc. CEO currently pays her $22,500 of temporary child and spousal support monthly, and Shannon is requesting that he has visitation rights only and joint legal custody of their kids.

--

&gt; Before filing for divorce December 1, Beador admitted to being unfaithful in 2015, and he went public with his new girlfriend mother-of-two Lesley Cook in February.

--

&gt; The new legal woes came the day after the blonde socialite was rushed to the Hoag ER with 'horrible pain in my ribs' but she's now safe and resting at home.

--

&gt; 'No blood clot and all is good,' Shannon updated her 1.6M social media followers. 

--

&gt; 'Heading home with an antibiotic. Thank you to so many of you for the well wishes. It's overwhelming and kind. #iamblessed.'

--

&gt; Fans can expect Gina Kirschenheiter, Kelly Dodd, Tamra Judge, Beador, Vicki Gunvalson, and Emily Simpson to all return for more drama on the 21-episode 14th season of TRHOC, which likely premieres next July on Bravo. 

--

&gt; 'All of the girls are being asked to return!' a source told Radar Online on Monday.

--

&gt; 'There was such great chemistry between all of the ladies this past season and **the fights were so authentic** and over-the-top.'

"They film 3-4 confessionals per season, which last usually three or four hours each. Comments that further the storyline along, commenting on drama, etc. are compiled from those hours of footage and are then edited into the programs. Nowadays these confessionals are filmed at a studio or on a green screen using the backdrops of the wives' houses, B-roll they would have filmed the first season they were on their shows.

When I attended Holidays with the Housewives, Kelly Dodd said it was common for OC to do whole days of confessional filming, from 6 a.m. (when wardrobe and hair comes) until 7 p.m. (when the camera turns off for the day). She said it can be difficult being ""on"" and energetic for 10 hours of filming a day. Shows like NY and NJ don't film for so long each time. 

Kelly and Dorinda said during the Holidays show I attended that they all pick a number of outfits they want to wear, and then production has to approve the looks and if they are approved, they are styled and they wear the outfits, one look per filming session/day. ",1

"Laura's claim to have been Chief Stew is wearing thinner and thinner for me, I think. Maybe she was a chief Stew by default because she was the only stew?

IDK, I guess if she had worked with a team I would have expected her to come to speak to Kate differently. You know, privately, not in the middle of dinner service, with respect (even if it felt unearned), and laying out true grievances. Instead, she starts a screaming match in the middle of dinner and comes off looking unhinged. But someone that's held the position should at the very least act like they know what holding the position is like, and Laura seems like every other completely unqualified third stew I've ever seen on the show. I mean, Bugsy was hella annoying with her ""I was Chief Stew!"" claims, but she at least showed some level of competency to back it up!

I'm sure it's frustrating being the third wheel. I felt that for Caroline too, but I think we've all had experiences like that and you just put your head down and do the work and get through it. And that kills me. They're on the boat for such a short time overall! Like 6 weeks right? You can totally suffer through shitty leadership for 6 weeks. Heck, I did it for 8 years!

Was it a housewife who demanded the comments be disabled? Did Andy make the decision or a higher up? I just used to love reading the blogs and seeing what real people were saying. It gave a whole different dimension to viewership. Now barely anyone even writes the blogs and when they do it's half assed at best.

In order to even be on camera guests at a party either have to sign a form or production has to have a notice in like sign form that if you walk into the party you are consenting to be filmed.

"nope, women's only purpose in life is to make babies!!!!!!!",1
Seriously...Can I get a little of whatever is? I know it‚Äôs not that tea he‚Äôs shillin‚Äô ,1
I would totally listen to a Stephanie/LeeAnne podcast.  I just can't deal with Brandi.,1
He‚Äôs the number one guy in the group obviously,1
She always looks like a deer in headlights with those crazy eyes!,1
My biggest takeaway from this episode is that there are actual people in their 30s that choose to do a power hour. Like what.,1
"Omg I‚Äôm so dumb. I was thinking of Kristen saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the sharpest tool in the shed, but I‚Äôm pretty!‚Äù ",1
"I have no idea why they're doing a Bravo themed podcast when they clearly hate Bravo's actual audience.  Seems like a waste of time.  They could do a podcast on any weapon forging or garbage picking or BBQ pitmaster show and their target audience would lap it up.  Women are bitches, gay men are sinful devils, and non-white people should go back where they came from.",1
that was a beautiful moment,1
Whyyyy the random dogs humping??!! Dead. ,1
"Look outside, pigs are flying today! ",1
He looks like a little boy who had a wish to be a man but it went wrong and they just stretched him out to adult size.,1
He's obviously been spending a lot of time with the Toms,1
"Honestly the dress on its own isn‚Äôt bad at all... the same can‚Äôt be said of the attachments imo. Having two very different fabrics attached with snaps is going to immediately draw attention to the seams where anyone with decent eyesight can tell that it‚Äôs been clipped on, even if it‚Äôs from the underside. I like that she says it‚Äôs like wearing 10 pairs of spanx tho because I‚Äôve yet to find a little black dress that I could wear without spanx and not have raging underwear lines!",1
Have you seen Nailed It! on Netflix yet? Because my sister and I have been watching it for DAYS,1
"I don't know...I think the real drama with LVP could make for an interesting season for a change, depending on how much Bravo runs with it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the first BH season I've been looking forward to in YEARS, because I'm looking forward to seeing how it all unfurls on camera.",1
"So how does this facetune stuff work. Because it‚Äôs mentioned all the time and I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôve figured out Instagram as well as I have. It‚Äôs really interesting that our Bravolebs don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll notice a whole new face but I highly doubt they care as long as the Bravo coins roll in. But that‚Äôs definitely Jax with a new face, however he got it or scrubbed it out. ",1
"&gt;Ohh that was so awful I blocked it from memory.  That was awful!
&gt;
&gt;It really seems like they think their target audience is 45 year old mountain men whose longest-term relationship is with their first cousin/auntie.

Then why do they do a Bravo podcast? I would think mountain men aren't necessarily Bravo's demographic.",1
"Fuzzy phone cases skeeve me out. 
SO MANY GERMS",1
Haha this is a Luann quote from last season.,1
"Ross had a Jim moment (the office) mouthing ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù to the camera about Laura, and it fucking killed me. ",1
"they're all fake af, you think Katie has genuinely changed and stopped thinking Lala is a whore? she's faking it to get on the private jet",1
Shannon is very clearly an alcoholic and it was clear from day one (her love of only vodka being a clear sign). The daughters probably want her to not drink and at the reunion there were hints that some of the girls probably didn‚Äôt want to live with her ,1
why are the eyebrows bothering me so much,1
No way! I loved Tyler and Ross' t shirts,1
"I‚Äôm finally almost done with this book I had to take a hiatus from back in October, and I already decided the next book I want to wrap the year up reading. But I accidentally packed it and spent last night removing tape from all these boxes until I finally found it üôÑ",1
because none of their attempts at making money outside of the show have worked. ,1
Didn't she just get separated? ,1
If you look closely it's still there...just *very* blurred out,1
I agree with you. I would rather just do something myself than have someone claim they could do things 100x better than I could but have to follow behind them and do it myself anyway.,1
why? she's literally world famous. I know much lower down trashbags who've been there,1
"yeah he did her dirty. I fully believe Scheana when she said he would say 'I love you' in private, then refusing to say it on screen was cruel",1
"If you say it out loud, you're automatically married! He has a girlfriend I think. I love cooking shows but always get so hungry when I watch them. I really do enjoy watching GBBO but I felt the past season was a bit odd.",1
üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª Nailed it! His name was Hans lol ,1
I blame the Sunday VPR episode. It fucked my week.,1
I am so sick of remakes.,1
"I'm down a rabbit hole with the Netflix cooking shows and I have discovered the delicious snack of pavlova that is Adriano Zumbo. That bald head, that look he gets in his eye when he's eating a pastry, that accent...is he married? What am I asking? Of course he is. To ME now.",1
I agree. I don't think you get to that level in that industry without being able to no react when you want to. It is a quality I wish I had.,1
And some of the combos (like the red bottom and white ruffle sleeves) look like a Halloween costume. I feel like that turns a lot of people (like me) off who might be into a dress with detachable sleeves and bottom.,1
"Ugh, who won‚Äôt this brand work with?? Cardi B, that one Jenner, a forgotten 90 Day Fiance season 1 star and now Jax Taylor.",1
"I don't think any of the stateside housewives would dare pull the present switcharoo that Janert did last season with Gina's rocking horse. That was wild.

Half of what Gina comes up with and spouts at the opportune time (cause I sure don't believe she makes those up on the spot)

&amp;#x200B;

Melbourne has almost all the best moments in HW history, there's too many to count!",1
"I saw this comment somewhere else, but let‚Äôs be honest, would properly do the same thing lol. Also, this is why I keep shit I don‚Äôt want housekeeping to see closed in my luggage, because I know they‚Äôll go through the closet (to put back robes and laundry, etc) ",1
I had this exact thought this morning.,1
This is true ,1
We ask them extremely detailed questions based on what we need for the edit -Producer ,1
"I think it was Cynthia and her friend from New York back in like season 4 who said it best. There‚Äôs a difference between having money for labels and having actual, personal style and you don‚Äôt always need money for that. ",1
"I legitimately can‚Äôt believe this isn‚Äôt a failed Sonja Morgan product idea.

Like, I could see it being included with the toasters.",1
I think Rhylee was the only adult on that podcast.,1
Fellow old person here with you ‚úä,1
I think the edit was spot on.  Caroline hasn't been out in the world showing off how she's a mentally balanced human.  Bravo can't be blamed for her current Twitter account.  She is who they showed us she is.,1
He looks 90 years younger ,1
Y‚Äôall just made me realize I need a Law and Order sandwich üòò,1
I would love to be as calm as Kate is ,1
"Their schtick is really poorly thought out, for a group of people trying to make a go of a podcast about a TV show whose audience is predominantly women and gay men.

I actively seek out content about Bravo shows, but I'm not going to waste my time on people who consider me a waste of air because I'm a woman, and having an opinion means I need to be put in my place with a good fisting. ",1
These two were the poster children for what happens when you stay in a bad marriage too long ,1
I would rather work with someone who is boring and good at his job than someone who is fun but incompetent. ,1
"I‚Äôve read for other shows that production asks questions and then the person doing the interview responds in a complete sentence restating the question. This is very obvious watching VPR.

I‚Äôve also read that sometimes producers keep people until they get the answer they want or talk about something different to invoke the emotion they want and then go back to talking about the show. I don‚Äôt think that happens so much with the housewives, but is possible. ",1
"Unfortunately for the thieves, no original content was found. ",1
"Of course he is, but I‚Äôm here for her putting Tamra in her place ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
It‚Äôs the rosy cheeks!,1
Whatever it is made his skin too smooth haha,1
Like in prison ‚Äúgay for the stay‚Äù.,1
"Laura complained about how dirty the interior was, bragged about how much experience she had, didnt do her job correctly, then complained that she had to do laundry. Maybe if she wasnt such an insufferable know it all, kate would be nice to her. ",1
"I've been meaning to watch Cucumber and Banana, it's tough to find these shows sometimes.",1
"How is it only Wednesday, tho?",1
What does vocal fry mean?,1
Yeah I loved both series and I can't picture it. This show also really needs to be R rated and I don't know if they can go that far.,1
He needs to be the third amigo! With special appearance from Ashton,1
have you forgotten the infamous milky stain on a pillow that was discovered after Kat and Ben stayed in,1
"I keep seeing this everywhere and now I'm genuinely interested in checking out M2M! Would you recommend that I start at the very first episode of the series, or just the start of the most recent season, or...?",1
SAME. ,1
BH where Tom Girardi was kicking out LVP and Ken (‚Äúyou need to leave‚Äù) but it turned out they needed to go somewhere else. Girl bye. ,1
I love your flair. I miss Kristen Taekman on RHONY,1
None of my friends watch either. It‚Äôs so unfortunate üò≠üò≠üò≠,1
The hoarse chick has no game. She can‚Äôt let max out of her sight. If he even speaks to a female she pouts and makes sure to ruin everyone‚Äôs time.  I can totally see why she has problems dating. No one  likes to be obsessed over and smothered like that. Even if you feel that way you can‚Äôt show it. It‚Äôs pathetic,1
I think Kyle and Mauricio are wealthier than LVP tbh,1
"While saying, ""bad cat, no pussy for you.""",1
Is this Botox? Filler? I‚Äôm not hating it just can‚Äôt figure out what this latest face is made of,1
"wow, Wow, WOW",1
"No bc the below deck team has staff to empty the tank and have to allow the guests to shit on board. 

Everything on unanchored is done by the guests and captain and no one wants that duty ",1
"I can't tell if he's ""m'lady"" away from neckbeard territory or one ""put the lotion in the fucking basket"" from Skinsuitville.",1
You get the Mazel of the day!,1
He only earns the most because he works those promo deals better than anyone ,1
Yeah it seems like they‚Äôre  the only ones who even see the costumes. I don‚Äôt see a lot of meeting up with other costumed boat people ,1
"Sheryl crow lmao 

I despise her the most. She‚Äôs psycho and immature ",1
Carole looks great here.,1
The American version means so much to me and was such an important part of my life for so long. This makes me feel some type of way but I hope I love it.,1
I read that in Dwight Shrutes voice.  ,1
"HER FAV BANDS, *OKAAAAY?*",1
I always see the Grinch but Jafar is a good one too. ,1
Uncanny valley vibes ,1
This is ridiculous in my opinion. EVERYONE knows Sonja is a thirsty-name dropping-one upping-exaggerating-braggart. To ask that she make an exception to her personality for this one instance is silly. No one believes what she says anyway. It‚Äôs not like the fact that Sonja claims to know a partying John gives any credibility to the notion.  She‚Äôs bitching just to bitch. And to remind everyone that SHE is the one who knows them. ,1
"I‚Äôm watching my nephew today. He‚Äôs seriously the cutest! He was up before 7 am, but luckily he fell back asleep lol. ",1
"Yeah this. I hate to agree with Tamera but the Edie is gay rumours are completely different from Shane being a bitch. Kelly should of course phrase it more reasonabley but she isn't wrong &amp; neither is Tamera. 

Fuck that felt weird to write. ",1
Engagement #22? ,1
"Kim Richards strikes again. 

Just kidding

Seriously though, me thinks this is an inside job",1
This is literally a picture of a text conversation between two random sisters. How is this not a shitpost?,1
"Holiday party last night and after a few glasses of wine I said ‚Äúmazel‚Äù in response to something. Managing partner of a law firm, age 60, looks at me and says ‚Äúok Andy Cohen!‚Äù Thanks to the wine, and my overall love for Bravo, I started squealing. So much for playing it cool. I was just ecstatic I had a fellow Bravo fan in a work environment! At least the wine was good and I‚Äôm awake at 7 am firing away at work emails. No hangover. No bad decisions (minus squealing). No social media embarrassment. All the mazels for me. ",1
"No one really knows. I am sure there are plenty of people named Madonna and John John. She probably partied with impersonators, but she is Sonja and this is why I love her.",1
Those boots were...something!,1
"They have to speak in the present tense.  I‚Äôd imagine even after making up with someone, if you start dissecting the fight you can get riled up all over again. Particularly if you have producers asking leading questions...",1
"She fits the criteria perfectly, it‚Äôs all about being in a creative industry...she‚Äôs annoying but is on brand for them",1
They are STILL filming?,1
Wtf. He looks like a woman.,1
"Yep, the telltale vein in his forehead is missing ",1
I imagine it's like being told to speak as if you were there in the moment that time. Kind of like therapy 'walk me through how you felt back then' kind of thing. ,1
"I don't think Kate's an asshole, I actually like her, but I have to agree that Kate's not looking any better. Their situation has been escalating since Laura came on the boat criticizing their work. Kate should have nipped that in the bud immediately. She should have sat her down and set some expectations and boundaries, especially in light of how things went when Caroline. I get she's frustrated, but the attitude she's been giving Laura is petty and non productive coming from a leader. It does make for good TV though.",1
It was oddly relaxing making them line up perfectly.  Retail really allowed me to flex my OCD  ,1
"Gamble and Pettifleur facing off in that hotel bar in Manila. ""It's called a wage, and I earn it!""",1
"Janet mocking Gamble‚Äôs ‚ÄúEveryone in Melbourne‚Äù

I just love Janet. Lol",1
My thing is how to do they respond like they‚Äôre in a fight with someone if they have already made up before they filmed the confessionals? Are they easier on the other person when recapping it or do they HAVE to be angry and throw shade. When there is a big fight do they try to do the confessionals while the feelings are still fresh? ,1
They don't film the confessionals all at once. They have a set number of looks for continuity and these sessions start from mid filming through to when the episodes start airing.,1
Production shows them footage and asks them to respond and asks leading questions. They also sometimes show other housewive's talking head confessionals to stir drama ,1
And the iphone cover didnt?! What the hell is up with that iphone cover? ,1
"I went to see Erika Jane last night!! It was awesome!!! She was everything I expected, and the crowd was lit. After the show when we were waiting for our Uber Karen from Potomac walked past us! She was awesome, said hi to us and blew me kisses  from her car. The whole night was epic!!!!!! ",1
The exact same! ,1
She also said Madonna was outside when she had her fashion show though which leads me to believe she never partied with JFK jnr,1
I don‚Äôt understand why she felt she needs to push this 175 ways idea. Saying you can wear this dress 50 ways with one set of attachments still makes this a unique product. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs competing with a broad market of convertible dresses. ,1
"I'm only commenting on Katie Maloney, who we have watched on TV for 6+ seasons; no need to take it personally and get so defensive.  This ain't about you, boo! üòò",1
"'Don't EVER touch my husband!'

That dinner in Amsterdam is iconic for so many reasons. Kim calling Eileen a beast amongst them.",1
The worst part was the honeymoon home video of David naked. David most likely has a tiny üçÜ. ,1
Does he realize if she is off RH he will end up owing her MORE?!? ,1
Its so gimmicky &amp; looks like an infomercial dress. the only way to wear the dress 175 ways is if you buy all the attachments in all the colors. ,1
The comments in this thread are way more entertaining than the show. They should renew it just for all the jokes in here.,1
"The original UK version &amp; American version feel so complete already, IDK what a remake will achieve, unless they have all new characters (based loosely on the old ones is okay, to an extent.) I'd like to see a remake of The L-Word too, but I wish Netflix, HBO, Showtime or one of the other freer networks were handling it...

EDIT:
&gt;The new version of the show will feature entirely new characters in a new setting.  It is described as a modern take on the original British series that centers on a group of club-going friends who find support in the gay community following a tragedy.

Oh, okay. Yeah, this makes more sense. A literal remake with all the same characters doing the exact same shit in 2019 all over again would have been annoying. I would have preferred a Roseanne season 10 type of thing to that, but a totally new show with new characters is better.
",1
"This bugs me too! I checked it out and you have to buy all the different coloured attachments too, so it‚Äôs not 175 ways unless you fork out over $600",1
The pants killed me! I usually love her style but this needs to be burnt ,1
üòÇüòÇüòÇ,1
"All I could think of was how Laura was YELLING at Kate to ""check herself"", while YELLING. If she was YELLING at me I wouldn't turn around and say ""take your own advice""",1
"I live in NY, so it can‚Äôt be worse than ours. I‚Äôm not on a Bravo TV show for 7 seasons though.

Does anyone actually know their salaries? Maybe they aren‚Äôt getting paid as much as I‚Äôm giving them credit for. Which, if that‚Äôs the case, is terrible for them because 7 seasons of any TV show is a long time. ",1
He poisons them. Dumps their bodies overboard ala Dexter style. ,1
Situational hotness. It is a real thing. ,1
That's really easy money for basically doing nothing and create drama.,1
"Trust, but verify.",1
"Y'know what's off about him, he's a ""nice guy"". Like the woke yoga bae but still expects something in return for his niceness. Notice how quick he turned on Caroline and then Ashton, and now on Laura. He's a faux.  ",1
"I don't remember the news or the story being that ""drinking"" was the reason for anything about that plane crashing. What I do remember is that John Kennedy Jr. was a brand new pilot, had never flown in fog or rain, and that he had just broken/ hurt his foot and was wearing a boot on it and he shouldn't have flown that plane that night. It was dangerous for a novice pilot.. and ended up being tragic. So so sad. ",1
I'm not sorry but yeah I can't stand Brandi at all. ,1
You guys are cute apologising to each other.,1
"It's not exclusive in the grand scheme of members clubs, completely feasible for trash like Scheana to be a member.",1
"Hahahahaha

That Brandi and Rinna exchange was pure gold!",1
it feels SOOOO much better to make people eat their words after you've caught them talking shit and you turn around and contradict their words with your over and beyond actions. no point in getting riled up. prove 'em wrong,1
That's just low and dirty. ,1
Stop the fuck was such a glorious moment. I hope one day I can use it with such power too.,1
"Any moment with Lydia in it really. At one point she gloats that her housekeeper will never leave her because she has confiscated her passport. I would watch her read the phone book though, everything out of her mouth is reality TV gold. ",1
YOU WILL NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN ,1
I would probably drink all day. I don't even need food. ,1
It's too old for him.,1
"YES. also from Minnesota, I can‚Äôt stand the way she says Sore-eeee. Wtf is that!? Girl, we can hear that accent is fake. ",1
Very Countess. ,1
Ohhh yeah I totally forgot that. Wonder why they would leave it out. ,1
His food is though so the fat kid inside me feels very conflicted bc he‚Äôs still creepy af üò≠,1
Or how almost dying in a dangerous accident makes you want to change your life to more danger? ,1
This episode really made me love him.,1
Shit. Over it. ,1
I‚Äôm more distracted by her new teeth!,1
"And they hype it up, probably talk nonstop about it all year. And then it's what? On a boat that's on one breakdown from being scrapped. Drinking nonstop and acting like dirty children. Hanging out with resentful people. Imagine all the people who've had to endure stories and pics who are getting to see what these trips really are lol",1
"Very true, plus it could have been head trauma. 
I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the experience would not be something he‚Äôd want to talk about. 
",1
Surprise! He's a boat agoraphobic.,1
"He's probably really Big too, like too Bi.",1
"Kate can't smell, so food never smells appetizing to her.",1
"And they're not allowed to go poop on board, ""shit on shore"". Is that why their always in the water to bathe and go to the bathroom?",1
One could order containers from Amazon to disguise the \*real\* contents and make it look like personal care products.....if one were so inclined....,1
"She was spreading gossip that another girl's crotch smelled or something. They were trying to make her become another Kristin Cavalleri, but she was too boring for that. ",1
I don‚Äôt know how I feel about jax earning the most. One side he provides the most drama but on the other he‚Äôs such a terrible person. He‚Äôs my bitch eating crackers ,1
"Yes, They're airing it and canning it I think.",1
We are not worthy üò≠üò≠üò≠,1
Laura is dumb af but I just can't stand Kate this season.,1
I still can't believe he's 30 years old. He looks like he's 19?,1
He would always be soaking wet.,1
"Me too... And also, It always bothered me when these women refer to them as ‚Äútheir gays‚Äù.  üôÑ As if they're pets or something.  Uggggh.  
Edit:I can‚Äôt spell ",1
Rent control. We also stay because of rent control and astronomical increase to rents in the past 3 years. Average rent in Hollywood 2011 was $800ish for one bedroom. 2015 it was $1500ish for one bedroom. 2018 $2100ish if you're luck to find an old building hidden away on a weird corner next to freeway. No one moves out of rent control if they don't have too. ,1
It's cool you're open minded! ,1
The same way she has equity in divorce closet ,1
You had me at soft pretzels ü•®. I love cheese (not a fan of beer) but I looovvveee soft pretzels or pretzel bagels. We don‚Äôt find them where I live. Only the little aperitif crunchy ones. That honestly sounds so good. ,1

"Hi Reddit! My name is Bryan Oringher and I spent the last 7 years working in the NBA as a Video Coordinator and Advance Scout. I spent 4 years traveling with the Washington Wizards. AMA! I spent 7 seasons in the NBA, including 4 years full time traveling with the Washington Wizards as their Head Video Coordinator. This is the same position Erik Spoelstra started in with the Miami Heat, and many other head coaches -- Mike Budenholzer, Frank Vogel, James Borrego, etc. -- also started in Video. In 17-18 I did Regional Advance Scouting for the Raptors and Hawks. Before all of this, I was at UMD with their basketball team as a Student Assistant during Gary Williams' last two seasons coaching. This year, I'm doing media content. You can find me on Twitter/insta @ScoutWithBryan, on my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/bryanman8), and all of my content so far on my site [www.ScoutWithBryan.com](https://scoutwithbryan.com/).

""**LEAGUE EXECUTIVES ARE** puzzled by the Suns over the MarShon/[Dillon Brooks](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3155526/dillon-brooks) snafu, of course, but more so in how they've just waived [Tyson Chandler](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/984/tyson-chandler) and Austin Rivers so early in the calendar. They both were on the last year of their contracts and could have been used in potential trades before the deadline.

OK, the Suns are tanking and have told teams they're not interested in taking on future money, but these moves slam the door shut on many opportunities, and those players could've been bought out after the deadline. Even if just acting as a third team to facilitate a deal and pick up an asset.

When you add in Darrell Arthur, who was waived over the summer, Phoenix is paying nearly $30 million to guys who will never assist them in anything ever again. Not great business.""

"Dion Waiters on comments he sees on his weight gain: ""‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do it for the internet,‚Äù Waiters says. ‚ÄúFuck it. Some people live for that shit. It‚Äôs one big-ass circus. I could‚Äôve been posting pictures this whole time. I won‚Äôt be their clown. I don‚Äôt play for social media. That‚Äôs coward shit.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do it for the internet,‚Äù Waiters says. ‚ÄúFuck it. Some people live for that shit. It‚Äôs one big-ass circus. I could‚Äôve been posting pictures this whole time. I won‚Äôt be their clown. I don‚Äôt play for social media. That‚Äôs coward shit.‚Äù

While Twitter had a field day with Waiters‚Äôs media day photos, he was focused on losing the 15 pounds he gained while he could barely walk. ‚ÄúRehab fucking sucks,‚Äù Waiters admits, but he still works out two times a day to get himself back in playing shape. He currently has a chef prepare his meals, and Bub is on hand to make sure he doesn‚Äôt give in to any cravings.

‚ÄúThe internet is a lose-lose situation,‚Äù Waiters explains. ‚ÄúYeah, I blew up. But people don‚Äôt see the other side of it. They don‚Äôt talk about how I played on a broken foot. They don‚Äôt know about the everyday grind.‚Äù

""I wanted to fight through it,‚Äù Waiters says when explaining why he didn‚Äôt have surgery two offseasons ago. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been injured like this before, I‚Äôve never had big-time injuries. But playing through it made it a lot worse. I want this to be the last time.‚Äù

What started as a sprained ankle turned out to be much more serious. Waiters had been playing through a stress fracture in his foot at the start of last season. The surgery on his ankle lasted seven hours, requiring ligaments to be tightened, two screws to be inserted into his foot, and a scope for good measure. For the next five months, Waiters was largely immobile. When he finally got out of his cast after three months, he was in a walking boot for the next two. It wasn‚Äôt until well into the summer when he could even consider stepping onto a basketball court. In the meantime, he needed help navigating the stairs in his own home. He had to shower sitting down, with a plastic bag tied over his ankle. And most regrettably, he wasn‚Äôt even on the bench during the postseason, with Miami facing his hometown 76ers, his childhood friend Meek Mill in attendance.


‚ÄúAll of it put him in a dark place,‚Äù says Waiters‚Äô closest friend, Rashawn ‚ÄúBub‚Äù Cunningham. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt go out much. He got a taste of what it would be like to lose the game.‚Äù

Waiters endured the process in obscurity, not making public statements as his star faded.

‚ÄúI was battling stuff within myself,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúEverything was taken away. When this happens, you find out how much you really have to dig to get back.‚Äù


‚ÄúI hate when people say I got paid. Fuck the money. I want to play. But I don‚Äôt need to tell the entire world. They don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù


‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm better than a lot of these guys in the motherfucking league,‚Äù Waiters says when questioned about what he can bring to the Heat. ‚ÄúI only gave y‚Äôall a taste. I know I can do more.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm back,‚Äù Waiters says with a smile, flexing his left bicep for emphasis.

"Kareem Abdul-Jabaar played 6 seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks. He has more 30/10 games (160) than every other player on the Bucks COMBINED (142) [Source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;team_id=MIL&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=30&amp;c2stat=trb&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=10&amp;order_by=pts)

I have a feeling Giannis Antetokounmpo is going to change that stat soon where it will no longer hold true, but this shows just how dominant Abdul-Jabaar was. To have more 30 point/10 rebound games than any other player in franchise history is one thing, but to have more than literally every other player combined is on another level.

Keep in mind that he only played 6 years with Milwaukee (467 games). That means **he was putting up a 30 point/10 rebound game, on average, once every 3 games** (2.91875 to be exact).

For those that are about to say that it was a different era, if you look at the entire NBA in that 6-year stretch, Abdul-Jabaar had 160 of these games. [The second closest player was Bob McAdoo, who had 88](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;year_min=1970&amp;year_max=1975&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=30&amp;c2stat=trb&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=10&amp;order_by=pts).

Who could forget Joe Fulks, apparently the original Black Hole. Dropped a hot 37 points on 50 shots.

Fulks did it twice. Elgin Baylor, Kobe, and Rick Barry each did it once. Wilt did it 14 times.

Fulk, Baylor, Kobe, and Barry all won their 50 FGA+ games.

##Small Tangent:

Some of those opponents:

INJ = Indianapolis Jets

SYR = Syracuse National

CHP = Chicago Packers (I almost want a Chicago Packers shirt for my Bears and Packer friends)

CHZ = Chicago Zephyrs (Minor league baseball in New Orleans used to be the New Orleans Zyphers)

PHW = Philadelphia Warriors (in 1962 they moved from Philly to California)

#Question: What happened during the 80s and 90s?

The NBA only had 9 games where a player attempted at least 40FG in a game in 20 years.

Michael had 4 of those 9.

No other player did it twice.

Mark Aguirre, Dominique, David Robinson, Shaq, and Hakeem each did it once.

---

NO PLAYER took 40FGA in a game between Mark Aguirre (11/14/1981) and Michael Jordan (11/28/1986)

1,840 days between 40FGA games.

It seems this had to do with the Illegal Defensive Assignments rule implemented in 81-82

---

The next big gap in 40FGA games seems to be when the ""Hand Check"" rule was changed in 07-08

NO PLAYER took 40FGA in a game between Kobe Bryant (1/14/2008) and Kobe Bryant (12/22/2012)

1,469 days between 40FGA games.

---

Is it correct to assume those two rule changes results in those gaps OR was the NBA lacking a certified STAR IN THEIR PRIME between Gervin in 79 and Jordan in 86?

"[OC] Best Consecutive Numbers Teams! (players wearing 0,1,2,3&amp;4; etc) Hi r/NBA,

Inspired by some of the other novelty team posts such as the one that only let teams run players born in that city, I decided to do my own: best ‚Äúconsecutive numbers‚Äù teams!
Starting with 0,1,2,3,4; I‚Äôve created squads with one player wearing each consecutive number from that group of 5.

For simplicity‚Äôs sake, I only used active NBA players and used the players‚Äô current form for my consideration (for example, Melo did not make a squad).  I also tried not to use injured players for the same purpose, but it‚Äôs possible I missed some.

Also for simplicity‚Äôs sake, I decided to be as strict as possible with not stretching players to other positions.  I know, I know: positions are so new players can understand the game and don‚Äôt really matter all that much, etc.  It just made it easier to complete and that‚Äôs how I stuck with it.  I used players‚Äô basketballreference profiles for this purpose.  The ones that have two positions listed, I picked one of them (or the hilarious Giannis with every position but SG listed), otherwise I used their listed position.  I did have to get a bit creative toward the end which you‚Äôll see below.  

I do think it could be more fun getting creative with the lineups position-wise (for example I had a hard time finding a good point guard in the 20‚Äôs bracket, we know Lebron has run some point type stuff in the past so why not stick him there; etc), maybe we can do that in the comments.

If a team was missing a player here or there, I just went back a year or two and found a G League guy basically.  If a team was missing a bunch of players, I eliminated that team from the league.  Oh and also 00 got shafted because it doesn‚Äôt really fit in, sorry Aaron.
So without further ado, the teams!

**TEAM 0/1/2/3/4**  

* 0 ‚Äì Andre Drummond ‚Äì C  
* 1 ‚Äì Devin Booker ‚Äì SG  
* 2 ‚Äì Kawhi Leonard ‚Äì SF  
* 3 ‚Äì Nikola Mirotic ‚Äì PF  
* 4 ‚Äì Victor Oladipo ‚Äì PG  
* *Honorable Mentions ‚Äì Russ, Dame, Tatum, Kuzma, Klove, D‚Äôangelo, John Wall, Lonzo* 

This was a tough decision because there wasn‚Äôt a ton of talent at the C and a TON of talent at the PG.  I felt like Kawhi and Mirotic were locks because Kawhi is Kawhi and 3 didn‚Äôt have a ton going on.  The only C I really wanted was Drummond at 0 so I had to skip Russ and Dame and ended up with Vic running the point.  This one could possibly be built better, let me know what you think.  Also, going back to my thing about being strict with the positions, this one could be built better if like Nikola could be stuck at the Center, etc. 
This team has some serious firepower, with the five putting up a combined 96.5PPG this season.  Obviously that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs how it would convert but it‚Äôs telling as to their offensive arsenal.  You also have really strong defense and rebounding between Kawhi and Drummond.

**TEAM 5/6/7/8/9**  
* 5 ‚Äì Montrezl Harrell ‚Äì PF  
* 6 ‚Äì Lance Stephenson ‚Äì SF  
* 7 ‚Äì Kyle Lowry ‚Äì PG  
* 8 ‚Äì Zach Levine ‚Äì SG  
* 9 ‚Äì Nikola Vucevic ‚Äì C  
* *Honorable Mentions ‚Äì DeAndre Jordan, Serge Ibaka, Andre Iguodala, Jaylen Brown, Eric Bledsoe, Danilo Galinari*

This is a strong squad with good playmaking but is hampered a bit at the SF position due to needing to start Stephenson.  It‚Äôs possible that a rebuild featuring Danilo at the PF and Fox at PG would make more sense, or you could even drop Vuc for Jordan at the C to open up room for Ibaka.   

**TEAM 10/11/12/13/14**  
* 10 ‚Äì DeMar DeRozan ‚Äì SG  
* 11 ‚Äì Kyrie Irving ‚Äì PG  
* 12 ‚Äì Steven Adams ‚Äì C  
* 13 ‚Äì Paul George ‚Äì SF  
* 14 ‚Äì Michael Kidd-Gilchrist ‚Äì PF  
* *Honorable Mentions ‚ÄìJames Harden, Klay Thompson, Tyreke Evans, Mike Conley, Avery Bradley*

Really strong team however you construct it, but tough build.  Missing out on Klay and James is rough.  But there aren‚Äôt a ton of good PG‚Äôs or C‚Äôs here so I think Kyrie is necessary, and passing on Adams to take Harden means you need to drop PG for Tristan, which I guess could be fine.  Oh, and Ingram could probably play the 4 better than MKG (even though he‚Äôs a twig), but you already read my rules.  Swap those in your brain, if you like.  There just weren‚Äôt really any good PF‚Äôs in the #‚Äôs that I could find, so something had to give.



**TEAM 15/16/17/18/19**  
* 15 ‚Äì Nikola Jokic ‚Äì C  
* 16 ‚Äì Pau Gasol ‚Äì PF  
* 17 ‚Äì Dennis Schroder ‚Äì PG  
* 18 ‚Äì Matthew Dellavedova ‚Äì SG  
* 19 ‚Äì Troy Williams ‚Äì SF  
* *Honorable Mentions ‚Äì Clint Capella, Kemba Walker, Jonas Valanciunas*

Another tricky one.  Not the strongest sequence of #‚Äôs so you can‚Äôt really skip on Jokic, which leads to a sketchy Pau Gasol PF (you could run James Johnson there too, I honestly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs better) PF pick and there just isn‚Äôt a ton of talent across all the positions.

**TEAM 20/21/22/23/24**  
* 20 ‚Äì John Collins ‚Äì PF  
* 21 ‚Äì Joel Embiid ‚Äì C  
* 22 ‚Äì Cameron Payne ‚Äì PG  
* 23 ‚Äì LeBron James ‚Äì SF  
* 24 ‚Äì Buddy Hield ‚Äì SG  
* *Honorable Mentions ‚Äì Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Gordon Hayward, Markelle Fultz, DeAndre Ayton, Khris Middleton, FVV, Lou Wil*

So yeah.  I think that Cam Payne was *literally* the only dedicated PG within these #‚Äôs (maybe I didn‚Äôt look at #23 or #21 so as not to skip Bron or Embiid, I forget).  Obviously LeBron could run the point better than Payne, but you know the rules.  Would love to know how you guys would construct this roster in a positionless manner, let me know!  It‚Äôs still a pretty fearsome squad, all told, but not as strong as some of the other rosters.

**TEAM 25/26/27/28/29**  
* 25 ‚Äì Ben Simmons ‚Äì PG  
* 26 ‚Äì Kyle Korver ‚Äì PF  
* 27 ‚Äì Rudy Gobert ‚Äì C  
* 28 ‚Äì Alfonzo McKinnie ‚Äì SF  
* 29 ‚Äì Patricio Garino ‚Äì SG  
* *Honorable Mentions ‚Äì Mikal Bridges, Derrick Rose, Nurkic*

Patricio *who?!*  Yeah, #29 was looking rough.  I pulled Garino out of 2016-17 where he played 5 games for the Magic, putting up 0/1.4/0, .6 TOV, .8 PF in 8.6 MPG.  Combined with Alfonzo and Kyle Korver‚Äôs ghost and this squad is not looking too hot ‚Äì I‚Äôm not sure Ben and Rudy have what it takes to drag this team to any positive result.

**TEAM 30/31/32/33/34**  
* 30 ‚Äì Steph Curry ‚Äì PG  
* 31 ‚Äì Terrence Ross ‚Äì SG  
* 32 ‚Äì Karl-Anthony Towns ‚Äì C  
* 33 ‚Äì Robert Covington ‚Äì SF  
* 34 ‚Äì Giannis Antetokounmpo ‚Äì PF  
* *Honorable Mentions ‚Äì Julius Randle, Myles Turner, Marc Gasol, Wendell Carter Jr*

Ok, *now* we‚Äôre talking.  This team is certifiedly stacked.  Terrence Ross is the only piece that isn‚Äôt a stellar player, but he‚Äôs still having a really strong season off the bench right now.  Steph + Giannis + Roco + Kat is just an insane Big Four, and Terrence is shooting 39.6% on 5.5 3PA per game, so just stick him in the corner while the other guys do their thing.  

**TEAM 35/36/37/38/39**
* 35 ‚Äì Kevin Durant ‚Äì SF  
* 36 ‚Äì Marcus Smart ‚Äì PG  
* 37 ‚Äì Semi Ojeleye ‚Äì PF  
* 38 ‚Äì Reggie Hearn ‚Äì SG  
* 39 ‚Äì Jerami Grant ‚Äì SF  
* *Honorable Mentions ‚Äì Marvin Bagley III, Dario Saric*

Not actually a ton going on here.  Who even is Reggie Hearn, never heard of him in my life.  Oh, that‚Äôs because he played 3 games for the Pistons last year, 1/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0 literally 0 everything else.  His TS% is .75 so you guys better go nuts.  Oh and Jerami Grant wore 39 on Philly and since I didn‚Äôt play him at #9 I felt like sticking him here was fine.  This is the true Hardest Road for KD, but he probably can‚Äôt win with these cats.



**TEAM 40/41/42/43/44**  
* 40 ‚Äì Harrison Barnes ‚Äì SG  
* 41 ‚Äì Willy Hernangomez ‚Äì C  
* 42 ‚Äì Al Horford ‚Äì PG  
* 43 ‚Äì Pascal Siakam ‚Äì PF  
* 44 ‚Äì Bojan Bogdanovic ‚Äì SF  
* *Honorable Mentions ‚Äì Not really any*  

Yeah so apparently around 35 is where it really starts to go downhill.  Some glimpses of talent for sure, but not a cohesive squad.  Also weirdly literally EVERY single player playing this year within this number range is a forward or center.  Unless I missed something, guards do not like it up here.  So fuck it we have to get a bit creative.  
I‚Äôm running Al Horford at the 1.  He‚Äôs averaging 2.4 assists per game so he‚Äôs basically already a point guard.  Then we‚Äôll stick Harrison Barnes at the SG, he‚Äôs 6‚Äô8 and shoots the three well so whatever.  The rest works and fits, kinda. 

**TEAM 50/51/52/53/54**    
* 50 ‚Äì PJ Dozier ‚Äì PG  
* 51 ‚Äì Boban -- C   
* 52 ‚Äì Jordan McRae ‚Äì SG  
* 53 ‚Äì Caleb Swanigan ‚Äì SF  
* 54 ‚Äì Patrick Patterson ‚Äì PF  
* *Honorable Mentions ‚Äì Nobody*

This team is just terrible.  I had to actually use two #50‚Äôs (PJ and Caleb) and stick Caleb at SF rather than PF.  Boban can play like 2 minutes per game, Pat can‚Äôt hit the broad side of a barn, just nothing going on here.  
So here we have ten teams, and that‚Äôs because while there are a few nice players such as E‚ÄôTwuan Moore and Luka Doncic between 45-49 and 55-99, there aren‚Äôt enough players to build a squad.

So that‚Äôs about it!  It was fun to put these squads together but I‚Äôm by no means an expert and I‚Äôd love to hear your opinions on how to better build each team.  (Also let me know if I fucked any #‚Äôs up)

I‚Äôd also like to know which team you think would take the Finals if this were a hypothetical league!  Assuming no conferences, I think Team 30-34 would win in 4 or 5 vs team 10-14 or 0-4.

Joe Harris gets the impossible shot to go ,0
"In the last 19 games (following their 12-1 start), the Raptors won 6 out of 14 games when Lowry scores less than 15pts . They're 5-0 when he scores 15pts or more. Their only loss in their 12-1 start also came when Lowry scored less than 15pts. More notes inside. Some notes:

\- In their 12-1 start, Lowry had 4 games with less than 15. Three of those games were blowout wins (for the Raps) and Lowry shot the ball at 45-50% from the field. The one loss came in a came where he shot 3-14, and scored only 9 points.

\- In the last 8 games, the Raps of won 3 and Lowry has scored above 15pts twice, two of those wins came the only two times Lowry scored 15pts+.

\- In games that Lowry has scored 20+pts, the Raptors are 8-0

\- When Lowry has 10 assists or more, the Raptors are 12-4 (75% win rate), when Lowry has 9 or less assists, the Raptors are 10-3 (77% win rate).

\- \[This stat I found to be the most surprising\] Lowry has shot 25% or higher from the field 22 games this season, and he's shot below 25% in 9 games. When Lowry shoots above 25%, the Raptors are 21-1 (95% win-rate). When Lowry shoots below 25%, the Raptors are 3-9 (25% win-rate).",0

"Reminder: No One Has Ever Turned Down a Supermax Contract Kevin Durant was not eligible for the Super Max in 2016, OKC offer was 5 for \~150.

Demarcus Cousins was not offered a supermax by the Kings.

Paul George was not eligible for the supermax from the Pacers the year he was traded.

Kawahi Leonard was not offered a supermax from the Spurs.

Lebron James was not eligible for a supermax from the Cavs.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the talk about an Anthony Davis trade, please remember he would be eligible for \~$230 million dollars over 5 years and likely the largest contract in NBA History.

He would be walking away from 50-60 million guaranteed.  I hear a lot of hand waving about the supermax as if AD turning it down is a foregone conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

*Obviously there are other factors and never say never but as it stands now he would be the first player to do so.  For context: Lebron has a lifetime contract with Nike rumored to be valued at close to 1 billion.  KD's contract is rumored to be 300 million.  Kevin Durant is eligible for a 5 for \~$219 million contract this off season.  A 4 year free agent max (with the Knicks for example) would be around 4 for $155 million.  Players have taken less money to go elsewhere in the past but the consistent theme with those players was large outside money.*

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: For those debating whether or not the Spurs ever OFFERED Kawahi a supermax, here is the [Woj Bomb](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1012359787391090688?lang=en).  He would be traded less than a month later.   
The fear was not that he would turn it down, the fear was him actually signing it and having a disgruntled player on the hook for 220 million.  Just like Boogie, team decided player wasn't worth the risk.

"During a 10 game stretch in the 2016 playoffs. The 55 win OKC team went up against the 67 win Spurs and 73 win warriors...they went 7-3 in that stretch I feel like there is a big revisionist history about that OKC team. They were the underdogs in both series. I watched every OKC game that season Pre-season, regular season, playoffs. OKC had only two consistent players (Durant and Westbrook). Adams did not break out till game 2 vs San Antonio, Dion was dion, Roberson was roberson. They were effectively playing a 6 man rotation. Oh and Ibaka had regressed from his career year in 2015.

"The History of the Quadruple Double The Quadruple Double is one of the most rare feats in NBA History. It's only been done 4 times (not including Blake Griffin's recent 10 turnover ""quadruple double"")

1. Nate Thurmond in October 1974 (HOF)
2. Alvin Robertson in February 1986 (4X All Star + Former DPOY)
3. Hakeem Olajuwon in March 1990 (HOF)
4. David Robinson in February 1994 (HOF)

3 of those 4 are hall of famers, the other is a former defensive player of the year and 4X all star and arguably could be a hall of famer.

Nobody has accomplished this in 24 years. And really, nobody in the last 20+ years has come super close.

Besides those 4 quadruple double's, there have only been 25 other times a player has achieved an 4X8 in history

1. Clyde Drexler 3X
2. Michael Ray Richardson 2X
3. Larry Bird 2X
4. Alvin Robertson 2X
5. Michael Jordan 
6. Rick Barry 
7. Hakeem
8. David Robinson
9. Kareem
10. Nate Thurmond 
11. Chris Webber 
12. Fat Lever 
13. Ron Artest
14. Mookie Blaylock
15. Andrei Kirilenko 

&amp;#x200B;

Then we have some players who never made an all star game. One of which accomplished this feat twice

&amp;#x200B;

1. Johnny Moore 2X (26/13/11/9 in January 1985 and 17/13/8/8 in April 1985)
2. Ricky Rubio (12/10/9/8 in December 2015)
3. Frank Johnson (36/11/8/8 in October 1982)
4. Larry Steele (12/11/10/9 in November 1974)

In the 2010's decade Rubio has come the closest. Johnny Moore was a starting PG for the Spurs in the 80's who never made an all star game but is one of the more underrated passers in history with 5 straight years of 9 APG.

The other two are..interesting

Frank Johnson was a starting point guard for the Bullets who averaged 8 PPG for his career. He peaked early, and in just his 2nd year nearly recorded a quadruple double. He was also a backup on the Suns team that made the 1993 Finals.

Larry Steele was a career role player for Portland who never even averaged 10 PPG, but he was exceptional on defense (the first ever steals champion, fitting with his last name) and recorded a 12 point, 11 rebound, 10 steal, 9 assist game in October 1974. A game in which he shot just 4-13, but nearly recorded one of the few quadruple double's in history.

A 4X7 is more common, it's happened 141 times before.

Somehow this lists includes Steve Blake (15 assists, 8 points, 7 steals, 7 rebounds in April 2014) and Spencer Hawes (18 points, 16 rebounds, 8 assists, 7 blocks in March 2013)

Finally, in terms of a quintuple double, nobody has ever seriously gotten close and a 5X5 has only happened 18 times in history.

1. Hakeem 6X
2. Andrei Kirilenko 3X
3. Draymond 2X
4. Nicolas Batum
5. Marcus Camby
6. Derrick Coleman
7. Anthony Davis
8. Vlade Divac
9. David Robinson
10. Jamaal Tinsley

In terms of a 5X6, this has only happened 2 times ever. So technically, these two games are the closest anybody has ever gotten to a quintuple double:

1. Hakeem Olajuwon: 38 points, 17 rebounds, 12 blocks, 7 steals, 6 assists in March 1987 (and the Rockets lost)
2. Andrei Kirilenko: 14 points, 9 assists, 8 rebounds, 7 blocks, 6 steals in January 2006

I'm interested to see if anybody comes close in the future, who do you think could get there?",0
"NBA Referees official Twitter account owns it's missed call of Harden travel The offensive player gathers the ball while on his right foot. He then takes a step with his left foot (step 1) into a hop step, landing first with his right foot (step 2) and then illegally with his left (step 3). We missed this one - it is a traveling violation.

"My very obscure NBA Collection... Game Worn Armbands [https://imgur.com/a/BOGlDXk](https://imgur.com/a/BOGlDXk)

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the day a ton of NBA players who wore armbands/wristbands would add some personal flair to it by having something custom stitched on. I always thought these little details were amazing and interesting and thats when instead of asking for shoes or a jersey after a game I would go for the armbands. I have obtained most of these from being a season ticket holder with the Orlando Magic and having seats by the visiting tunnel (some I have traded or purchased through auction). I would always try talk to the players beforehand during shoot around to try to ask them if I could have it after the game. Majority of players were pretty cool about following through on their promise, but of course you would have ones that would forget or if it was a tough loss they would storm by. David Stern actually banned (no pun intended) customized armbands around the 06-07 season. In the past few years there have been a couple players that have been wearing customized armbands again like Marcin Gortat &amp; Evan Turner, hopefully we see more players following the trend in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway.. just thought I would share this very weird staple in NBA history",0

When talking about the greatness of David Robinson, the hosts went into a famous story about how a petty David Robinson scored 71 points in a meaningless final game of the season against the LA Clippers to take the scoring title that year over Shaq during the ‚Äò93-‚Äò94 season... by a fraction of a point.

"The REAL meaning of ""posterizing"" I've been seeing this particular word on nearly every dunk video on YouTube and here, that started bothering me a little bit recently.

Am I still living in the past or the meaning of this word did really change ? It is not posterizing if you dunk and guy was chasing behind you ""touched"" you. It is not posterizing if there happens to be a defender near you when you dunk.Not every dunk that defender tried to block is posterizing.It is not posterizing if you blow by the defender, and dunk when he is beside you running with.

I think we got to stop aggrandising the dunk just because the player we admire dunked the ball or matchup of the player we hate,dunked the ball. It takes the excitement of the word posterizing because now people make it seem normal with using it on practically every dunk.

Just my two cents.

 Vucevic is currently #9 in the league in real plus minus who contributes both on the offensive and defensive end. [http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm).

"Reminder: Most Rookies Are Bad This year and last year have kind of spoiled us and given us unrealistic expectations on what rookies can do. Yes, Mitchell and Simmons and Tatum and Doncic and the ilk were/are incredible, but don't let that distract you from the fact that being a rookie is really hard and that most rookies will struggle. I'm tired of this sub acting like every single game and mistake is a referendum on a rookie's entire career/worth as a human being. Figuring shit out takes tame (e.g. De'aaron Fox or Dipo) and it's useless to obsess over every little thing.

Also, statistically, it's unlikely that players picked outside of the top 5 will ever even become above-average starters. Most of the guys you pick--even in the lottery--will just be productive role players and it's a lot better to just accept that rather than loudly complain about how your 20 year-old lockdown point guard isn't as good as Donovan Mitchell (@knicks fans) ",0

"[Rankin] Trevor Ariza and the Suns made 'mutual decision' to part ways. Ariza checked out mentally early in the season, according to sources. Context:

According to league sources, this was a ‚Äúmutual‚Äù decision between Ariza and the Suns.

Ariza was a valuable trade asset, but he also wanted out of Phoenix after signing a one-year, $15 million deal in July.

Ariza checked out mentally early in the season, according to sources. After practices would ended, he‚Äôd leave before everyone else, when that's usually an opportunity to bond.

He'd break from the team huddle before his teammates and wasn‚Äôt engaged.

So the Suns ended up making a deal for Ariza on the first day they could after working on several before he could officially be traded on Saturday.

At this stage of his career, Ariza is all about winning, league sources said. And Phoenix hasn‚Äôt been doing much of that and has the NBA‚Äôs worst record even after winning its past two games.

That didn‚Äôt help matters, but Ariza, according to sources, found himself in a situation where he had to work harder than he anticipated in Kokoskov‚Äôs system. Offensively, he couldn‚Äôt just stand out at the 3-point line and wait for the pass to launch 3s.

Ariza had friend and fellow vet Ryan Anderson with him, as well as 18-year veteran Jamal Crawford, whom Phoenix signed before the opener, but no one else on the team has more than six years of NBA experience. The Suns have five rookies.

For a veteran, playing with a young team can be like babysitting, and Ariza wasn‚Äôt interested in continuing to do that.

"Come the playoffs, what opponents should your team fear and which ones does your team matchup well against? For example: (As a Nuggets fan)

Rockets are my worst nightmare.  They own us because spread pick and roll is our kryptonite. We'd lose in 5 even with home court and wind up with an offseason full of hot takes.

Warriors should obviously be heavily favored against us but we matchup with them better than arguably any team in the NBA because Jokic destroys their small ball lineups.  I dont want to see them til WCF but would enjoy watching the matchup either way and think it would go 6.

We should be favored against the Lakers but it's a series that could go either way.  We are better at literally every position than them minus SF AND have the better bench.  But Lebron is Lebron, we have nobody who can guard him reliably and the refs would most certainly be in their back pocket.

New Orleans would be a very tough series as AD is the toughest matchup for Jokic in the league.  But we'd have homecourt.

"Doncic's interesting stats in 8 December games Doncic in December is averaging 18.1 pts, 7.3 rebs, 6.5 asts, 2.9 TOs on 40/29/75 splits. [Game Log](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic)

An interesting thing to note is his shooting slump from the field but it is a reasonable slump, not an abysmal one so not sure if he is starting to hit the rookie wall or not. For sure he has to get his percentages back up for Mavs to have a better chance at playoffs.

However, there are some positive things to note as well. 

His assist totals are trending upward, in part because of the games DSJ and JJ Barea missed, with him having more of a point forward role and as a result starting to showcase more of his elite passing ability. He posted his first 10+ assist game yesterday and had 2 games with 9 assists in December (his career high was 8 assists before December). Let's see if he becomes the youngest player to record a triple double (he has 12 games to do it).

His turnover total is going down showing he is getting more and more comfortable with NBA speed.

His free throw attempt rate is trending up (3 games with over 10 free throws attempted in December vs only 1 such game before, averaging 8 free throw attempts per game in December vs 4 before) showing more of that craftiness as he is known for his ability to get to the line and again the rookie adjustment plays a role.

"Can someone explain why it's not in AD's best interest to decide his future NOW vs the Summer? The rumors are he's deciding between leaving or staying in NOLA and the 2 destinations are Lakers &amp; Celtics, since those two would have the most to offer presumably to Pelicans. 

1) IF he really wants to go to Lakers: Decide NOW since Boston can't actually trade for you during the season (Kyrie technically has to resign before they can sign AD due to Cap stuff), Lakers won't be in a bidding war, thus you would go to a team that doesn't completely deplete all its assets if you decide in the summer.

2) IF he wants to go to Celtics: Same reason as above, why would you want a bidding war with the Lakers in the summer? and mess up your desired destination.

3) So he's staying in NOLA?

Gary Harris feels like the perfect shooting guard for this team and is 24. Also they have Michael Porter Jr, and if he turn out to live up to those high expectation, then he can fit nicely in SF. He is 20 years old. Nobody has been talking about Juan Hernangomez. He is a great fit at SF for the Nuggets and also happens to be 23 years old. Will Barton has also been playing phenomenal averaging 16.5 PPG in 27 minutes. Paul Millsap honestly feels like a great fit to this young Nuggets team and is almost like a mentor to them. And if isaiah Thomas gets his shit together and comes back better than ever, there might be some problems. The Nuggets also have a great bench, with the likes of Trey Lyles, Isaiah Thomas, Tyler Lydon, Mason Plumlee, Malik Beasley and Torrey Craig. The Nuggets easily have the best young core in the NBA, with the Sixers and Celtics not far behind, and are currently first in the loaded Western Conference.

"Fun Fact - Stat Stuffing Greats This speaks to both longevity and the ability to stuff the stat sheet but I came across something pretty interesting. 

Barring injury or a drastic decline, by the end of next year LeBron will have become the first player to ever achieve 30k points 10k rebounds and 10k assists for the length of a career. 

As it stands he's the only player ever to put up 30k/8k/8k let alone 20k/8k/8k. 

So it got me thinking, who else has put up at least 20k/7k/7k?

Answer:

- Oscar Robetrson. He's the only one with 26,710 Points, 9,887 assists, and 7,804 rebounds. 

So if we lower the bar to 20k/6k/6k, that should make it more inclusive right? Nope! 

The only player ever, not named LeBron or Oscar to have career totals of over 20k/6k/6k is **Kobe Bryant!** he has amassed career totals of 33,463 points, 6,306 assists, and 7,047 rebounds. 

This is crazy to me for two reasons: 

-  It puts into perspective what LeBron has, and will accomplish with respect to his longevity and ability to accumulate stats in different facets of the game for his career.

- **Kobe Bryant!** I'm not one to disrespect Kobe, he's an all-timer, but that's not the name I was expecting to see when considering the criteria I was using. Other players came close to the 20k/6k/6k but this again is a testament to longevity and makes me respect him more for the all-around great talent that he was as opposed to just looking at him through the lens of a bonafide scoring great. 


EDIT - I'm not using he term stat stuffer in a negative context, this post is about appreciating how great these players are. ",0

"Why doesn‚Äôt the NBA offer compensatory draft picks? It would seem that in an effort to help small market teams rebuild faster, a compensatory pick would somewhat even the playing field and create the parity everyone is hoping for. 

If you don‚Äôt understand what compensatory picks are, essentially if a team in the NFL or MLB lose a player of value to free agency, that team is awarded an extra draft pick as compensation for their loss. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what the parameters are for such player but essentially a star in come capacity.

Obviously the NBA has so much free agent movement every year it would be hard to give a pick for every team that loses a player of value, but maybe if you reserved the compensatory picks to teams that lose all stars or all NBA players to free agency it could make a rebuild for those teams an easier process.

I point this out for two reasons:

1. Ten teams in the East have a negative DIFF. I would use this over record when making points about how much stronger the West is than the East.

2. I don‚Äôt buy the Kings and Griz as playoff caliber just yet, particularly the Kings. Many of their wins have been scrapes (comparatively) and they have some underperforming but better teams below them like HOU and NOP who are much more likely to turn things around.",0

"[ESPN] James Dolan would play his guitar on the Knicks' team plane -- even after losses, according to several witnesses. ""It was the last thing the players and coaches wanted to hear,"" says one regular on those flights. ""I just remember the looks on their faces."" Full context (Ian O'Connor was describing some of Jim Dolan's bad anecdotes from past years):

This is the Dolan dichotomy. Bad Jim is the owner who can be his own worst enemy, the contrarian who too often subscribes to the notion that whenever everyone in the room tells him he is wrong, that's when he knows he is right. (Dolan denies ever overruling a roomful of executives who unanimously agreed to paint the Garden roof black merely because he preferred to see a brown roof from his 26th-floor office overlooking it.) Bad Jim is the owner who once battled the Yankees and denied fans televised games as a casualty of unnecessary cable squabbles, and who inspired some Garden officials to wish his father would rein him in. Bad Jim is the owner some believe dearly misses the wisdom and guidance of Marc Lustgarten, who died of pancreatic cancer in 1999 (stirring Dolan's all-out support of the Lustgarten Foundation, which has directed $165 million to pancreatic cancer research) and who knew how to play away from Dolan's weaknesses. Bad Jim is the owner who years ago, on occasion, would play his guitar on the Knicks' team plane -- even after losses, according to several witnesses. ""It was the last thing the players and coaches wanted to hear,"" says one regular on those flights. ""I just remember the looks on their faces.""

&gt;This is a point I've often made as probably the biggest argument for MJ in the Jordan/James comparison. James' teams lost as big favorites 3x, although only 2 of those were due to him underperforming.

Personally I think this is only half the story. I'm interested in how a player elevates an underdog team just as much as how dominant they make a favourite. I think LeBron's Cavs beating the 73-win Warriors for example is the sort of feather Jordan doesn't have in his cap. Its definitely an interesting stat though, I didn't know it offhand ",0

"For the first time this season, the difference between the 1 seed and the 14 seed in the west is as big as the difference between the 14 and the 15 The Nuggets are currently in 1st in the West with a record of 20-9, while the Jazz are in 14th with a record of 14-17, making the Jazz 7 games behind the Nuggets and 2.5 out of the playoffs

The Suns are 7-24 making them 7 games behind the Jazz and 8.5 out of the playoffs.

In the West you have to go down to the 12th spot to find a team below .500, while in the East you have to go down to the 7th team.

"Does James Harden Really Get Better Shots Because Players Are Scared To Foul Him? The answer is mostly no. I had been seeing quite a few comments in threads recently stating this to be the case, so me being the Harden fan boy that I am decided to take a closer look to see if that was true.
Here is the breakdown:

* [Harden ranks 22nd on very tightly contested fga/g (when a defender is within 0-2 feet) and shoots 38.1% on those shots](https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-closest-defender/?sort=FGA&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)

* [On tightly contested shots (2-4 feet) he ranks 2nd in attempts and shoots 48.1% on those shots](https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-closest-defender/?sort=FGA&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CloseDefDistRange=2-4%20Feet%20-%20Tight)

* [On open shots (4-6 feet) he ranks 4th in attempts and shoots 44.1% on those shots](https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-closest-defender/?sort=FGA&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CloseDefDistRange=4-6%20Feet%20-%20Open)

* [On wide open shots (6+ feet) he ranks 242nd in attempts and 44.7% on those shots] (https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-closest-defender/?sort=FGA&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CloseDefDistRange=6%2B%20Feet%20-%20Wide%20Open)

I do acknowledge that it is possible James does get a few shots that are open a game due to his foul drawing abilities, but it does say a lot that most of the shots he takes are either very tightly contested or tightly contested. I also do know that it's not a big part of people who believe this, but it's just something i wanted to find out. One more little interest bit of info Giannis Antetokounmpo shoots 59.3% on very tightly contested shots and 70.1% on tightly contested shots!! The dude is a beast.

For those of you who may not be familiar with the concept let me explain it real fast.
So Golden State was last years champions.  So they have the[ Belt to start the season](http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2013/1220/grant_g_wallace_300x200.jpg)

When you lose the belt goes to the team that beat you.

"Every team in the NBA is starting to play the same way I have never been one to complain about change in the NBA. I agree that it‚Äôs annoying to hear people talk about how the NBA was so much better back then. However, I think it‚Äôs reached a point where it‚Äôs hurting the game. Every team seems to have the same strategy of playing fast and shooting lots of threes. It‚Äôs the only way to win at this point. Offense has become more important than defense because it‚Äôs so hard to play defense without fouling. There seems to be much less diversity in styles of play.

"Would you rather your team have a 3-0 record in championship series during their prime or 1-10? Either way your team gets at least 1 title, but going 11 times would be a lot and really fun even with all the L's.  However, a 1-10 record in the finals is bad enough to be made fun of at sports bars and in life in general.  3-0 is really cool.  Like, it's neat.  You get a few championships, the dignity of being undefeated in the finals, and you get to make fun of the 1-10 guys whenever you see them at sports bars.  But then one day, the 1-10 guys bring their stats nerd friend... and he shows your 3-0 guys the ""deep"" data.  The pub's lighting goes dimmer, you start feeling on edge...  The 1-10 team had statistical superiority to your 3-0 team all along.  And it wasn't even close.  You start to think back to all the times your team lost in the second round and you thought it meant nothing, like when your ex told you she faked her orgasms a few times a month because she wanted to be an actress, but then you find out from her best friend that she's actually faking it almost every time.  It turns out, your dyanasty was really nothing more than a few real orgasms interrupting a long run of fake orgasms.  Did your favorite players mail in entire postseasons?  Was the team chemistry not as merry and gay as you had been led to believe?  Now, you'll never really know... 

EDIT:  Surprised no one asked which conference these teams played in.  The 1-10 does not look good coming out of the east, but just looks like a complete choke job coming out of the more difficult west.  3-0 coming out of the east would just look like 3 miracle runs or a brief superteam whereas 3-0 out of the west was the 2000s Spurs.

Jarrett Allen will be a DPOY at some point in his career Allen is already averaging 1.3 blocks per game in his 2 seasons in the league. DeAndre Jordan a fairly good shot blocker is averaging 1.7 blocks per game meanwhile playing 9 more seasons than Allen. I know comparing him to DeAndre isnt the best shoes to fill but I still think it's something that should be recognized. I fully believe in the Fro-Force. ,0

"Teams Already Planning to Land Giannis Saw an article on Bleacher Report claiming this. I used to live down the hall from Giannis in Saint Francis, a suburb of Milwaukee in a condo complex. His mom lived right next door. When he finally bought a house this past summer, the Bucks had to stop him from having a garage/rummage sale to sell his old stuff. People just dont get where this kid came from and that another few dollars in marketing and notoriety will mean nothing to him in a few years. Article below for reference.

"In Michael Jordan's first year with the Wizards, he put up his lowest scoring output: 6 points on 2-10 shooting. The next two games, he put up 51 points and 45 points on 52.9% shooting. The lines for those games were:

51/7/4/3

"Should Toronto try to flip JV for TT? Hear me out! 

JV has been great for Toronto off the bench. No doubt about it. But TT has been playing his ass of this year and has totally redeemed his trade value. He's also one of the few guys in the league who can bang with Embiid and match-up against smaller, quicker centers like Horford, which is a huge asset come playoff time. 

Also, he's Canadian. ",0
"Tobias Harris tonight: 39 pts, 11 reb, 1 assist. Damian Lillard tonight: 39 points, 3 reb, 6 assists. Both of these players showed up well tonight, it was a hard fought and fun game to watch. It was also a career high for Tobias Harris. CJ, Gallo, Nurk, and SGA also all had good games tonight.",0
If the nuggets win the nba championship will jokic be the greatest nugget of all time?

"TJ Warren dropped 24 points in the 2nd half, including 17 in the 3rd quarter which matched the entire Knicks team. 3J Warren was ice cold in the 1st half, red hot in the 2nd. 

He was a 20 ppg scorer without a 3 pt shot last season, but now he's 9th in the league in 3 pt shooting. 

His splits are 51/45/86 on only 13.6 fgas per game. Put respect on his name",0
"Why is everyone hyping the Lakers as the destination for AD when Boston has the much better offer? Tatum is better than anything the Lakers can offer by a lot, plus Boston has tons of draft picks so the Pelicans can have Tatum and then also get their preferred guys to start their rebuild.

No way in hell the Pelicans trade AD before this summer when they can offer him the supermax and then hear Boston‚Äôs offer if he turns it down.",0

"Why did the Suns make the Ariza trade? I'm sorry if this has been posted, I haven't been on reddit much recently. Im just trying to wrap my head around the Ariza for Oubre and Rivers trade and I don't get why Phoenix pulled the trigger. 

They needed a guard and they got Rivers... then they cut him.

They have like 17 wing players... and they pick up Oubre (a wing) who they will likely let walk in free agency.

They didn't get any picks or real assets back, making the whole Ariza project a complete waste of time.

Considering Ariza was one the most touted trade prospects in the whole league for competing teams, I just find the whole thing baffling. Does anyone have any idea why Phoenix figured this was the move to make?",0

"[O'Connor] Utah Jazz are interested in trading for Bulls' Jabari Parker Excerpted from here: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/12/17/18144188/nba-trade-season-primer

&gt;Parker has remained a zero on defense who relies on the inefficient midrange to get his points. As a result, new Bulls head coach Jim Boylen is phasing Parker out of the rotation and the front office is looking to trade him, with ‚Äúseveral teams‚Äù interested, as K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune reported last Friday. Parker makes $20 million this season and has a non-guaranteed deal for another $20 million next season. It‚Äôll be difficult to find a suitor with the salaries and assets to make a deal that‚Äôs worth it for the Bulls, but there are options.

&gt;The Utah Jazz are one of the teams interested in Parker, according to multiple league sources. Derrick Favors is an awkward fit next to center Rudy Gobert, and his $16.9 million on the books for next season is non-guaranteed, meaning he could be one of the pieces involved. Favors can‚Äôt be traded until January 15, so Chicago would have to wait. Would it be worth it? The Bulls are loaded with young bigs, so it‚Äôs hard to see them taking back Favors unless additional assets are included. Utah has all of its future picks, except for a 2020 second-rounder going to the Cavaliers, and has two other seconds incoming.

&gt;Parker‚Äôs value has diminished, but the Jazz are desperate for offense. They rank 23rd in offensive rating this season, and last in offensive rating in the fourth quarter. Parker doesn‚Äôt care about playing defense, but the rest of the team does; if they can help him get stops, maybe he can help them buy a bucket.",0

"[OC] Film Study: Who is this Monte Morris guy? I've been a big fan of Monte Morris since he was quarterbacking Iowa State's ultra-efficient offensive attack in college, where he helped lead the Cyclones to a top-12 offensive rating every season. Back then he was lauded for his incredibly low turnover numbers and overall offensive acumen, but as a senior point guard with only decent athleticism and a good-but-not-great jumpshot his NBA potential was thought to be limited. After being drafted 51st by Denver in 2017, Morris spent last season crafting the best offense in the D-League with Rio Grande and has exploded this year in a backup role with the Nuggets. He continues to turn the ball over at a miniscule rate -- he's committed turnovers on only 6.6% of his possessions, easily the best mark among guards -- and he's scored efficiently: his mark of 116.4 points per 100 shot attempts ranks in the 87th percentile among guards, and is largely spurred on by his making 51 of 104 midrange attempts (49%) and 31 of 66 three-point attempts (47%). While those marks are likely unsustainable, there is certainly reason for the Nuggets to be pleased with how his scoring has flourished. Perhaps most importantly, Morris has helped to stabilize a Denver bench that has consistently fallen apart when Nikola Jokic rests. 

I wanted to highlight a few plays from last night's game against the Raptors that demonstrated Morris' crafty, cerebral play. The first is a side pick and roll that he ran with Trey Lyles. [Watch the play here](https://streamable.com/l0puw), and look out for two things. First, notice how when Lorenzo Brown first starts to go under the screen, Morris pauses behind the screen and starts to pull back towards the three point line. This forces Brown to adjust and go over the screen or risk giving up a wide open three, but as soon as he starts to get over the screen Morris explodes forward to take Brown out of the play. Second, see the quick up-fake he gives OG Anunoby, which causes Anunoby to commit to the ball handler and gives Lyles the split second he needs to disengage from the screen and start his roll. He follows it up with a perfectly-timed and placed bounce pass to Lyles for the foul.

Earlier in the second quarter, with Jamal Murray and Trey Lyles running a pick and pop on the opposite elbow, Morris ran a beautiful ""stunt cut"" which generated an open three for Malik Beasley. [Watch the play here.](https://streamable.com/9e9nv) To defend the screen action, Greg Monroe drops and Danny Green pursues Murray, which leaves the popping Lyles the responsibility of the nearest defender (in this case, Lorenzo Brown) to stunt at and deter a catch and shoot three. We see that as soon as Brown stunts to Lyles, Morris makes the stunt cut, darting to the rim unimpeded. Lyles doesn't hit him for the layup, but his cut causes a confusing switch that leaves Beasley open for a good look. This kind of cut isn't groundbreaking -- off the top of my head, the Celtics employ it quite a bit to leverage Al Horford's ability to shoot and pass -- but nonetheless it's a heady read by Morris to get a good look for his teammate that won't show up in the stat sheet.

Later, Morris made a couple of nice plays to get Juancho Hernangomez good looks from the corners. [Watch the first one here.](https://streamable.com/onpo6) With his man stunting towards the ball handler, Morris starts attacking before the pass even reaches him to beat his man. When OG Anunoby makes a rotation to stop the ball, Morris immediately makes his pass to Hernangomez who gets fouled on the three. At the end of the quarter, he runs a pick and roll with Nikola Jokic and gets Hernangomez another good look. [Watch that play here.](https://streamable.com/k6yh8) Again, after the handoff from Jokic he delves into the defense, sees the rotation from CJ Miles from the corner and hits the open man. Neither of these plays are especially exciting, but I think they're emblematic of what makes Morris such a valuable cog in Denver's offense. While he might not have the explosive athleticism to routinely blow by guys in isolation (although he did have one play last night where he blew by Danny Green like it was nothing), he's got wonderful awareness and control to maximize any advantage he gets from attacking a closeout or using a screen. And on top of that awareness, it's hard to find an example of him *not* placing his passes perfectly, even when he's on the move like we see in these two clips.

One thing that I did notice which should be kept in mind when looking at how well he's shooting is that he passed up a couple decent looks from three. [In this first one](https://streamable.com/3lfma), he has a good look when Delon Wright goes under Trey Lyles screen, but instead swings it to Mason Plumlee. [In this second one](https://streamable.com/r8x0p), he has an opportunity for a catch and shoot three when Wright stunts at Jamal Murray. Certainly these aren't *bad* decisions: in the first one, a pull-up three with 18 on the shot clock might raise some eyebrows and shorting the pick and roll with a quick swing to a strong passer in Plumlee opens up the possibility for a lob to Lyles; in the second one... it's never a bad idea to toss the ball to Nikola Jokic in the post. Still though, it's something to keep in mind when seeing Morris' outstanding three point percentage (and more generally when looking at anybody's percentages -- the kind of shots they're taking is important).

This hesitance to shoot is actually reflected in the stats as well. According to Second Spectrum data at NBA.com, 69% of Morris' threes have come with a defender more than 6 feet away. Contrast that with teammates Jamal Murray at 64% (57% last season), Malik Beasley at 51%, and Gary Harris at 43%, it's clear that he's selective with his three point shooting. Again, this isn't inherently a bad thing, and for a great passer like Morris it's not hard to imagine that he's able to generate plenty of efficient scoring chances for his teammates when he decides to pass up on a three, but it's still worth contextualizing his numbers.

Overall it was a solid night from Monte Morris: 12 points on decent shooting, 4 assists and zero turnovers. But take a closer look and we can see how his cerebral play helped to elevate the Nuggets attack.

"Would you rather add Vucevic or Ariza to your team for this year only? A Study in positional scarcity. So comparing Vucevic and Ariza this year at first glance seems completely ridiculous.  Here are their numbers this year:

**Vucevic: 21/12/4 on 54/40/84 (.601 TS%)**

**Ariza: 10/6/3 on 38/36/84 (.525 TS%)**

Vucevic is clearly a better player.  On offense Vucevic is a good one on one scorer, a very effective shooter, and a good passer.  On defense Vucevic isn‚Äôt a game-changer, but he isn‚Äôt awful.  Meanwhile Ariza is merely a decent 3 point shooter, a pretty good (but not great) wing defender, and is an ok passer.  The only real comparison that is in Ariza‚Äôs favor is that Ariza plays the wing, and Vucevic is a center, but what a difference that is.

Due to the switch toward small ball in recent years, and the fact that many of the dominant scorers are wings (Lebron, KD, Kawhi, Giannis) having a large wing who can space the floor and credibly guard wing scorers is unbelievably important in the playoffs.  Ariza isn‚Äôt great at either, but he is one of the few non-stars that is credible at both.  To showcase that value (and the declining value of offensive centers) I thought I would go through the potential playoff teams this year one by one (basically every team but PHX, NYK, CHI, CLE, and ATL) and try and figure out would they rather add Ariza or Vucevic to their current roster.

**Golden State:**  An interesting start, because a lot of it depends on how Boogie looks.  If Boogie is mostly/fully healthy, he‚Äôs basically a better version of Vuc so they would definitely prefer Ariza.  If Boogie is a non-factor they would probably prefer Vuc.  Judging by reports the Warriors seem pretty optimistic about Boogie so I would say they would prefer **Ariza.**  Ariza allows them to run a version of their death lineup with Ariza instead of Iggy (if Iggy can‚Äôt turn it up again for these playoffs), and provides another solid wing defender.

**Raptors:**  Probably the team that needs either player the least.  However, between Valanciunas, Ibaka, and even Siakem the Raptors are totally set at Center.  I‚Äôm not sure Vucevic is clearly better than Valanciunas (their per 36 numbers are remarkably similar), and he is already getting his minutes reduced.  **Ariza** would slot right in at the backup 3 (and start when Kawhi sits), and could easily play with Kawhi in closing lineups.

**Celtics:**  Another tough one because of their lack of need at either position.  I think they would ultimately take **Vucevic** because of Horford‚Äôs ability to play the 4 (and his decline this year), and because between Hayward, Tatum, Brown, Smart, and Morris they have plenty of two way wing players.  

**Thunder:**  They would easily take **Ariza.**  Between Adams and Noel the Thunder have a great Center rotation, and can really use another shooting wing that won‚Äôt jeopardize their defense.  He also could step in for Grant if his shooting falls off.

**Bucks:**  They easily take **Vucevic.**  Start him over Brook Lopez, and have 48 minutes of Splash Mountain.
 
**Rockets:**  Well considering a big reason for their dropoff is lack of good wing play, from losing Ariza, I think it is safe to say they would take **Ariza.**  Vucevic would provide some solid offensive center play when Capela sits, but he can‚Äôt really execute the switch defense Houston runs.

**76ers:**  While Vucevic would be amazing at backup center, I don‚Äôt really see how he can play with Embiid.  That limits him to about 15 MPG at maximum.  **Ariza** on the other hand can slot right in as a better Wilson Chandler.  He would help bolster a defense that already has some already impressive defensive personnel, and would help their never-ending fight to space the floor.  

**Nuggets:**  Between Plumlee and Jokic the Nuggets are totally set at Center.  However, they could definitely use a 3 &amp; D small forward.  They easily take **Ariza.**

**Pacers:** This one is unbelievably tough.  While their center lineup is fine with Sabonis and Turner, they also have plenty of decent wings.  For the sake of seeming impartial I will give this one to **Vucevic,** but I am legitimately unsure who they would take.

**Jazz:** Another tough one.  Vucevic would help at backup center, but probably can‚Äôt play with Gobert.  Meanwhile, the Jazz have plenty of wings but a lot of them are only one way players.  Ariza is probably closing for the Jazz, but Vucevic is definitely not.  I‚Äôll go with **Vucevic** here even though I would personally probably take Ariza.

**Pistons:**  Well this one isn‚Äôt hard.  The Pistons are fine at Center, and desperately need a decent 2 way wing.  They take **Ariza.**

**Lakers:**  While their Center rotation has done surprisingly well, and they could use some wing help, they would clearly take **Vucevic.**  He would be the 2nd offensive option to Lebron, and boosts their offense tremendously.  

**Portland:**  If a team ever needed both it is this one.  While they could definitely use the talent boost of Vucevic, they just need 2 way wings in the biggest way.  They would take **Ariza.**

**Hornets:**  They also could use both players, but they would definitely take **Vucevic,** as he would be a great offensive fit.

**Pelicans:**  Between the 3 starting level Centers they already have on their roster, and complete lack of large wing defenders they are taking **Ariza** so quickly it isn‚Äôt even funny.

**Wizards:**  Well considering they already have Ariza they are definitely taking **Vucevic.**  However, even prior to the trade I think their Center depth is so bad they would have taken Vucevic anyway.

**Clippers:**  Neither position is a huge need for the Clippers, but between Harrell, Gortat, and Boban the Center rotation is locked up tight.  Meanwhile they could use a 3rd wing to play with Gallo and Tobias.  They would take **Ariza.**

**Grizzlies:**  Between Marc already being a great center, and their lack of two way wing play, I think it‚Äôs pretty clear they take **Ariza.**  Vucevic would help with backup center, but Jaren and others can cover that, and they don‚Äôt really have anyone who can do exactly what Ariza does.

**Magic:**  Well this is awkward.  Why don‚Äôt we just skip this one.

**Timberwolves:** They just got a better version of Ariza (Covington) and his impact is showing just how important a 2 way wing really is.  I think with Towns already covering the Center minutes they would prefer **Ariza.**  Also you know Thibs is dying to get a guy like Ariza.

**Nets:**  Jarrett Allen is good, but **Vucevic** is a significant enough improvement that I think they clearly would take him.

**Heat:**  I could go into detail about Whiteside, and how the Heat have plenty of wings, but let‚Äôs just leave it at the Heat would easily take **Vucevic.**

**Mavericks:** What a weird one.  While the Mavericks have a very solid Center rotation, they also have a decent wing rotation.  Also, this team needs a solid infusion of pure talent, and **Vucevic** brings that.  They would take him.

**Kings:** To quote Kings fan /u/TheFoxKing5 ‚ÄúWe have a massive hole at the 3. Like a Riley Reid gaping hole.‚Äù  They would definitely take **Ariza.**

**Spurs:** They have a few problems, but nothing more so than their defense.  A good wing defender like **Ariza** is something they really need and would take him.

So that puts the grand total at 10 for Vucevic, and 14 for Ariza.  Even if you disagree with a few of what I said, the fact that this is even close is very revealing.  Centers, especially offensive oriented centers, are like the running backs of the NBA.  Between the abundance of them, and the fact that you can only have 1 of the them on the floor at the same time really limits their usefulness.  Meanwhile big 2 way wings have never been more valuable.  I think the Suns really messed up trading away one for such a limited return, and the Wizards are going to to find Ariza makes quite a difference when facing a lot of teams.

"Here's a newspaper article from when Popovich fired Bob Hill and took over the role of Head Coach Yesterday, u/MiloIsCute posted about this so I figured I'd dig into some of the circumstances surrounding the firing of Bob Hill.

TL;DR - In December of 1996, Spurs' GM, Gregg Popovich, fired Bob Hill after going 121-43 over his first two seasons as HC. Fans were mad.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's a newspaper clipping from a San Antonio newspaper on Dec. 12, 1996](https://imgur.com/n5o1QLe)

&amp;#x200B;

Before the 94-95 NBA season, the Spurs and their new owner, Peter Holt, hired Gregg Popovich as their General Manager. Together, Popovich and Holt hired Bob Hill, former Head Coach of the Knicks and Pacers, as the new coach of the San Antonio Spurs. Bob Hill had been largely unsuccessful during short stints in New York and Indiana, but got off to a quick start in San Antonio. In Hill's first season as Head Coach of the Spurs, they finished with a record of 62-20; good for 1st in the Midwest Division. But they would ultimately lose to the eventual NBA Champion, Houston Rockets, in 6 games. The following season (95-96), the Bob Hill coached team would finish 59-23, again winning the Midwest Division. However, after 6 games in the Western Conference Finals, the Spurs were defeated by Stockton and Malone's Utah Jazz.

&amp;#x200B;

After a 3-15 start to the 96-97 season, Gregg Popovich fired Bob Hill and appointed himself as Head Coach of the Spurs. Gregg Popovich cited Bob Hill's supposed 'loss of the locker room' as his reason for firing him, but Hill adamantly denied those allegations. In fact, Spurs' star David Robinson had yet to play a game that season due to a lingering injury. And despite the Spurs' solid roster, they had no one to carry the load, offensively or defensively, when The Admiral wasn't on the court. The 3-15 start to the season was almost justifiable when looking at their roster without Robinson. When questioned by the media about the Spurs' poor start, Bob Hill cited a ""lack of manpower"".

&amp;#x200B;

Although David Robinson would only play in 6 games in the 96-97 season, Bob Hill's words continuously rang true as the Popovich lead Spurs finished with a dismal 20-62 record; going just 17-47 under Gregg Popovich. Looking back on Pop's career in San Antonio, we cannot fault him for his decision in December of 1996, but we can question his reasoning. Did Pop think the 96-97 Spurs had a real shot of turning around their season or was he just waiting for a reason to fire Bob Hill and take over his duties?",0

He was the vocal point in the San Antonio franchise that made the playoffs all but one season he was there.  He beat Lebron 2 out of the 3 times they met in the finals.  I think we look pass just how efficient Duncan was when he step on the court. He got the better of Lebron while he was in the league which is why he was at one point, the best player in the NBA.

"How bad has Trae Young's season been so far? Trae Young is having a historically bad shooting season (or a historically green light). He's shooting 24.1% on 5.4 attempts from three point range. Nobody has done this before when playing at least 20 games (Kevin Love shot 21.7% on 5.1 attempts in 18 games in 12-13).

Only two rookies have ever shot under 38% FG while shooting 14 field goals or more per game. That's Brandon Jennings (14.8, 37.1%) and Trae Young (14.5 attempts, 37.8%).

For reference:

Rookie Brandon Jennings per 100 possessions: 24.9 pts, 9.2 ast, 3.9 tov, 2.1 stl, 5.8 reb (100 Ortg, 104 Drtg)  
Trae Young per 100 possessions: 24 pts, 11.3 ast, 6.1 tov, 1.1 stl, 4.2 reb (94 Ortg, 118 Drtg)

"[OC] On Luka Doncic, those damned assist numbers, and do the Mavs really brick more off of Doncic's passes? Hello everyone, I did a short write-up on Luka Doncic yesterday on r/Mavericks and, since I got a lot of positive feedback over there, I thought posting it here as well might be a good idea. Below is the full version, but I've also created a post on [medium.com (which you can visit by clicking HERE)](https://medium.com/@RobertRo7e/on-luka-doncic-and-those-damned-assist-numbers-e95ca1ed8693) as it allows for better formatting and inserting pictures and videos along with the text. Hope you find it an enjoyable and interesting read!

If you've been following the Mavericks' season at all, you're most likely aware just how good the team's Slovenian rookie is already. After a mildly concerning preseason, Luka Doncic has has surpassed all expectations, at least when it comes to scoring. This has happened in large part thanks to his unexpectedly-long shooting range and a sensational step-back three. Despite the recent spell of poor shooting, he's averaging 17.8 points per game on 14.1 attempted field goals, equating to roughly 1.26 points per attempted shot. To contextualize the number: this efficiency puts him slightly ahead of Klay Thompson's last season (1.23) and a notch below the three-time champion over his 4 all-star seasons (1.27). Additionally, any doubts about his viability as a closer at the NBA level got erased by the the fourth-quarter run against the Rockets. In a way, this has been the theme of his season so far: dispelling any pre-draft doubts about the potency of his game in the best basketball league in the world.

Mavericks' 2018‚Äì2019 was widely expected to be a retirement-tour season for Dirk. All of a sudden - well, more like two months and an ankle injury later - became one about Nowitzki passing the torch and everyone seems to be much more interested in the Doncic-does-Dallas narrative instead.

Yet ‚Äî regardless of overachieving in the put-ball-trough-hoop department, the impressive (relative to his position) rebounding, and a better-than-expected defense ‚Äî one aspect of the rookie‚Äôs game has left fans scratching their heads. The ability to create for others hasn‚Äôt translated nearly as well as most expected, at least not on the box score. Last year, he averaged 4.6 assists in 25 minutes, over the course of 61 games to win the ACB and EuroLeague MVP awards. The number itself may not seem as impressive to NBA fans, but that was enough for Doncic to finish EuroLeague 10th in assists, both total and per-game average. Furthermore, the dazzling passes and his court vision had scouts and draft experts drawing comparisons to a young (and nowhere nearly as athletic) LeBron James, Manu Ginobili, and other gifted passers. As per Marc Stein, a Western conference official described the best case scenario for Doncic‚Äôs as a ‚Äú6-foot-8 Steve Nash‚Äù.

Two months into his first NBA season, the budding star is averaging only 4.5 assists per game (APG) at more than 32 minutes and even this number includes a recent bump up from 4.3. The lack of progression on the box score is conspicuous, especially when combined with the 3.5 turnovers per game, 9th most in the league. What makes it that much more glaring is Trae Young - whom Luka continues drawing comparisons to as a result of the draft-day trade and comparable profiles of great passers lacking in athleticism - ranking 11th in the league with 7.1APG in under 30 minutes a night on a on what is without a doubt a worse team. Still, the eye test tells us that Doncic is every bit as good as advertised when it comes to delivering the ball into his teammates' hands. Flashy and creative passes, resulting in both makes and misses, have found their way to the NBA social media space almost every night the he laces up.

*The question then becomes, why is it that such an obviously-talented passer is seemingly unable produce?*

In this case, the box score number doesn't tell us the full story. To begin with the most obvious, Luka has been sharing the playmaking duties with others. The conventional wisdom of the modern NBA dictates that you cannot have too many playmakers in a lineup, but it's no secret either that their individual stats tend suffer when you have more than a few. After an eager start of the season, a contract-year Wesley Matthews may have curbed his point god aspirations, but Dallas still has J.J. Barea coming off the bench. For 19 and a half minutes a night, the offense is (successfully) ran by the six-foot veteran and stats corroborate the eye test on this. Regardless of having significantly less playtime than either Dennis Smith Jr. (28.4 min/game) or Doncic (32.3 min/game), Barea generates a comparable amount of passes and his assists numbers topple those of the young point men, as per stats.nba.com. The rest of the game, Doncic often shares on-court time with Smith, who receives the most touches and holds on to the ball the longest out of anyone on the team. Thus, despite receiving most minutes of the trio and having had his usage rate gradually climb up to 25.1% over the last two months, second only to Barea's 26.2%, the rookie is not (yet) the focal point of of the team's offense.

Luka Doncic with an over the top celebration after dropping a dime for DeAndre Jordan.

Luka seems to have won over the fans and many are ready to call the Mavericks his team only two months into his tenure at Dallas. Coach Carlisle, however, appears to be aiming for the playoffs in a stacked Western conference. If that's the target, giving the keys to the team's offense to a teenager, whom he hadn't seen play live until September, isn't the right move by any stretch of the imagination. Furthermore, pigeonholing European prospects into a specific role has been a mistake NBA teams have made time and again. This doesn't necessarily apply to Doncic whose natural position on offense, in spite of his size, is point guard. That said, allowing a well-rounded prospect to get a feel for how the full breadth of his game fits at the NBA level - before putting on him the burden of running a team's offense - is a smart idea and may end up benefiting Luka long term. Some teams prefer to let their lottery picks to run the show and learn amid a strong tanking effort, but there's also something to be said about utilizing a gifted prospect as a cog in a successful system. As recently as last year, with Jayson Tatum, we saw that this approach can draw out the best of a rookie just as well, if not better.

Another popular explanation for Doncic's underwhelming assists number has been that the rest of the Mavericks's fingers turn to butter the moment he drops them potential dimes. It gets repeated so often that one wouldn't be faulted for thinking it's an excuse, rather than an explanation. As far as the eye test goes, shooting off of his passes does appear to result in bricks more often than anyone else's, even on wide open shots. The numbers corroborate that to a higher degree than one would suspect. The Slovenian's 4.5 assists per game come off of 9.5 potential assists per game (PAPG). Less than half of the shots coming off of his passes are converted into field goals. To put the numbers in context, Barea's 5.4APG come off of 9.6PAPG and Dennis Smith Jr.'s 4APG require 7.7PAPG. Luka's 47% conversion ratio is the worst of the three and perhaps that isn't too surprising with him being the last to join the roster. What is much more curious, however, is that it is the worst on the team, among players who've recorded an assist.

---

In fact, 47% is the conversion ratio of LeBron James' potential assists during last season's playoffs. Yes, the run during which the rest of the Cavaliers were repeatedly accused of having a particularly poor run of shooting. To help you contextualize the number even better, below, I am including a table with some notable names among the five hundred players with most potential assists this season.

[Table with rankings N2.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wtfgNYCt90Kc4AXAKWk_ug.png)

---

*So what does this mean and can Doncic do something to improve in this aspect?*

For starters, spending more time on the court, with the rest of the roster, will naturally help both parties learn how to convert those passes into more assists. He will start figuring out where teammates like to receive the ball and they'll get better at expecting his passes. Additionally, spending time in the NBA gym room and following a strict diet (potentially spiced with some Mexican supplements) will improve his physique and strength, which will assist in the matter as well. Doncic carries around a decent amount of weight (218lbs, according to the Mavericks' official book), but he is far from chiseled and his frame can afford to carry more muscle, without slowing him down. His passes may be beautiful, but they're far from bullets. Almost lackadaisical, they rely on finesse and vision, much more so than speed, not to get interrupted. Oftimes, even calling them darts would be attributing too much velocity to the ball. Slower-moving ball gives savvy defenders more time to close the distance to the shooter and contest the shot, naturally resulting in a miss more often. As Luka gets stronger, he'll be able to get the ball into teammates' hands quicker.

Let's be real, Doncic and his trainers are much more able than me to figuring out ways for him to improve this part of his game. The idea behind this section is to point out the ridiculousness of the notion that the Slovenian rookie is anywhere close to a complete product by showing two simple ways he could become more effective in just one area of his game. Only six months ago, the highlight of his game was his passing. Now  ‚Äî still white and thicc, [as the song goes ](https://youtu.be/JE23ajVX930) ‚Äî  Luka is scoring at moderate volume with an efficiency comparable to that of a four-time all-star, showcasing a stepback that's almost as mean as James Harden's on a nightly basis. The lack of athleticism puts some obvious limitations on his game. It's doubtful he'll ever be a high-flying menace in the vein of LeBron James or Charles Barkley, no matter how much time he spends in the gym or jumping over objects in his backyard. Yet, with every passing game that looks less likely to be something holding him from achieving the status of a star.

Two months into Doncic‚Äôs NBA career and two more away from him turning 20, the prospect of him becoming a 6-foot-8 Steve Nash doesn‚Äôt appear to be nearly as outlandish as it was only six months ago.",0

My nominations, in question form: 


Is it the Kings, who watched their team lose that controversial game 7 and then watched the front office make every wrong decision possible, and have had to hear rumors about the franchise moving since as long as I can remember? 


Is it the Suns, who've seen their team acquire legends like Steve Nash and Charles Barkley, only to be boxed out by Kobe's Lakers, Duncan's Spurs, and Jordan's Bulls? 


Is it the Hornets, because they have to get technical when talking about the team's history and specify between Charlotte Hornets, New Orleans Hornets, and Charlotte Bobcats?

Is it the Clippers fans, for having everybody use their team as a punchline for pretty much the entire existence of the franchise and then watching injuries from stupid stuff like Blake Griffin punching things disrupt the team's success even in the best of times? And for having to share LA with Lakers fans? 

Is it Blazers fans, for supporting a team that's 6th in all-time regular season win%, but only 19th in all-time playoff win%?

"Where does Austin Rivers go? What teams want him? He was pretty good for the Clips last year, though awful with the wiz. 

Clippers have a deep guard rotation and a 15 man roster, so memes aside I kinda doubt he goes back.

Lakers, Rockets, Philly, and the Pels are playoff teams clearly looking for depth. These teams mostly want wings, which Austin really isn't, but I could see them take a swing at it - Doc used to play him at the three.

Spurs could use some defense, depth, and guards so I could see it. Same with Grizzlies, who clearly are comfortable signing projects as they just did with Noah.

Thunder could use him as a budget Roberson while they await his return, and pray he hits some threes because they have no shooters.

Or can he take the hardest road and win one with the dubs? Probably the best time line to see Austin hoisting the trophy like a god while KD and Steph look on with envy.

Anyway, please guess where Austin goes.

"The curious tale of D*ck Lee and the Anaheim Amigos The ABA was the NBA's rival basketball league between 1967 and 1976, at which point the Nets, Nuggets, Pacers, and Spurs were absorbed into the NBA and the ABA was shut down for good. Many original ABA teams did not survive more than a few years, including the Anaheim Amigos, who played their lone season in 1967-68. They were immediately one of the worst teams in the league, as they finished with a 25-53 record (including 19+ turnovers per game) and lost $500,000 over the course of the season as they failed to compete with nearby Disneyland as a local attraction. In fact, with attendance dipping into the double digits, three Amigos home games were transferred to Honolulu. Even so, operations became so cheap that players were granted a single pair of socks at the start of the season and were expected to supply all other gear themselves.

However, the Amigos' greatest legacy is perhaps the story of Dick Lee. Stricken by injuries yet unable to afford replacement players, Amigos owner Art Kim was forced to activate Dick Lee as a substitute in order to fulfill roster requirements. Thing is, Dick wasn't a pro basketball player at all-- he was the team's public relations director. Dick quickly donned an Amigos jersey and entered the game on two occasions, registering 1 rebound and 1 assist as a ""forward.""

Following the season and subsequent rebranding as the Los Angeles Stars, GM Jim Hardy declared, ""This is a brand-new franchise. We will have new players, new uniforms, new management, as well as a new home. The Amigos have been buried, and we burned their uniforms after the final game.""",0

"What's up with the Jazz? They lingering near the bottom of the West. Don't seem to be able to get on a roll.

Hard schedule?  Donovan been figured out?  Something else?

Edit: They added another shooter in Korver, to go with Jingling Joe. Their D has elite potential.   
My gut told me it was Donovan, but it appears from responses its more chemistry and schedule.

"Why This is LeBron's Most Awe-Inspiring Season Yet The conversation surrounding LeBron can turn into somewhat of a circlejerk as we all fawn over the nuts shit he does every season, but what he's doing this season is fucking nuts.

LeBron is in his 16th season in the NBA and is turning 34 in less than two weeks time, and was averaging 27/7/7 splits on 60.3% true shooting percentage before tonight. So far this season LeBron looks like he's been improving since he turned 30 rather than regressing. While he's dishing fewer dimes than his time in Cleveland and grabbing less boards, he's scoring more points, shooting better from three, and maintaining an efficiency similar to the one he held during his second spell in Cleveland. These are his per 36 numbers and shooting stats between 2014 and 2018 compared to his this season:

|Year |FGA|FG%|3PFG%|eFG%|TS%|RPG|APG|PPG|PER|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2014-18|18.4|52.5%|34.8%|56.8%|60.1%|7.5|7.9|25.7|27.3|
|2018/19|20.3|51.9%|37%|57.3%|60.3%|8|7.2|28.7|26.6|

With over 15 years worth of NBA minutes on LeBron's back, and as he slides into his mid-thirties, LeBron has managed to maintain the numbers that helped bring a championship to Cleveland. In a historical context, LeBron's performance this season has also been ridiculously good for his age. Only Karl Malone charted a higher PER at the age of 34 than LeBron so far this season:

&amp;#x200B;

|Player|FG%|eFG%|TS%|RPG|APG|PPG|PER|OBPM.|DBPM.|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Malone (34)|53.0%|53.1%|59.7%|10.3|3.9|27.0|27.9|5.7|1.4|
|LeBron (34)|51.9%|57.3%|60.3%|7.7|7.0|27.7|26.6|6.0|1.1|

LeBron's season so far isn't quite as good as Malone's MVP season in 1997-98 but LeBron had far more NBA mileage on his odometer than Malone at this time. LeBron's stats look even more impressive when we account for the fact that he's in his 16th season of NBA basketball. Playing over a decade and a half of an 82 game regular season will take a toll on most NBA players, but LeBron seems to have maintained his exceedingly high level of performance at this point in his NBA career as opposed to other NBA stars. Only three other players have ever averaged at least 20/3/3 in their 16th season in the NBA, keeping them in touching distance of LeBron's current season totals:

&amp;#x200B;

|Player|MPG|FG%|eFG%|TS%|RPG|APG|PPG|PER|OBPM.|DBPM.|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Kareem (Yr.16)|33.3|59.9%|59.9%|62.8%|7.9|3.2|22|22.9|3.6|1.3|
|Kobe (Yr.16)|38.5|43.0%|46.2%|52.7%|5.4|4.6|27.9|21.9|3.6|\-1.4|
|Malone (Yr.16)|35.7|49.8%|49.9%|57.2%|8.3|4.5|23.2|24.7|4.2|1.7|
|LeBron (Yr.16)|34.7|51.9%|57.3%|60.3%|7.7|7.0|27.7|26.6|6.0|1.1|

&amp;#x200B;

LeBron is the standout player even in the midsts of some of the NBA's best, putting the ball in the bucket at a better efficiency than Malone while contributing more to his team's success than Kareem. LeBron's season is on track to be quite possibly the best 16th season in NBA history.  It is also worth noting that at this stage in his career LeBron has played more minutes at this point in the season than all three of Malone, Kobe, and Kareem played by the end of their 16th seasons in the league, including over 10,000(!!!) playoffs minutes (an NBA record).

The longevity of LeBron has basically been something close to superhuman. To have already played more NBA minutes at the age of 33 than all-time minutes leader Kareem did when he was 37 without seeing any significant physical regression or suffering any major injuries alone is almost unheard of. To do that and still be on track to lead a 35-win Laker team to the playoffs, post MVP-caliber numbers and have the best 16th season in NBA history is a really once in a lifetime type thing. ",0
"The only players averaging over 7 3PA/G on less than 34% from 3 this season are Eric Gordon (8.3, 28.8%) and Devin Booker (7.2, 31.8%). This has only been done 7 other times in NBA history. [Bball ref link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=fg3a_per_g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=7&amp;c2stat=fg3_pct&amp;c2comp=lt&amp;c2val=34&amp;order_by=ws)

Pretty surprised at how poorly these guys are shooting this year, especially Booker. Gordon, on the other hand, has been on a downward trend since 14-15. And before anyone complains about cherry-picking, keep in mind that the list starts to grow pretty quickly (especially the all-time one) the more you raise the percentages/lower the attempts.",0
"What‚Äôs the worst contract decision a player has made in NBA history? Inspired by McCaw‚Äôs declining of a $5.2mil deal.  Certainly not the worst, but it looks like he‚Äôll lose out on exactly $5.2mil.  This isn‚Äôt huge money in the NBA, but it is for a borderline player like McCaw.

Noel is certainly in the fight, turning down 4/$70mil expecting a bigger payday that never came.  I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the worst ever, but it‚Äôs probably the biggest amount of money lost in recent memory.  

What are some under-the-radar decisions that cost players big money for them but not necessarily NBA-big?",0
"[Serious] Which player that has been retired for more than 10 years would score the most points if they were brought back for a single game? If their life depended on it, who would score the most, and how much?

Also, how much could Jordan do at age 55? He had some 40pt+ games when he was 39. Could he manage 20pts?

Right now, Hayward's definitely not playing up to par, averaging 10-5-3 on 53% TS; not too bad, but certainly not what you'd expect from a player of Hayward's caliber. Yes he's recovering from an injury, but what if he doesnt return to form? Say he doesn't recover by the end of the season; will Ainge try and flip him, or maybe give him another season and see if hes still got it? Maybe trade him to Brooklyn for 10 1st round picks?",0

Most articles say Grizz/Sac picks could be packaged for AD but how is that possibly if free agency doesn‚Äôt begin until after the draft?",0

**Recent Injury News:**

* Devin Booker returned from his hamstring injury on Saturday, scoring 28 points in 36 minutes, helping the Suns beat the Timberwolves.
* Lou Williams has missed the Clippers‚Äô last two games, and is expected to miss at least another week.
* Goran Dragic played in the Miami Heat‚Äôs game on December 10th, but has since missed their last 3 games.  He remains day to day.
* Brad Stevens said on Wednesday that Al Horford will miss a couple games with a knee injury.  He‚Äôs missed the Celtics‚Äô last four games.
* Brandon Ingram is out until at least Friday with an ankle injury.
* Otto Porter Jr. missed all three Wizards games this week with a right knee bruise.
* Jonas Valanciunas dislocated his left thumb against the Warriors on Thursday and will miss the next 4 weeks.
* Marvin Bagley III will miss the next two weeks for the Sacramento Kings with a left knee bone bruise.
* Zach LaVine hurt his ankle against the Magic and will miss a couple games this week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Recent Transactions/Rumor Mill:**

* After a lot of drama, the Washington Wizards traded Austin Rivers and Kelly Oubre Jr. to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for coveted trade target Trevor Ariza.
* Nick Young joined the Denver Nuggets on Monday, and has seen playing time in each of the Nuggets‚Äô last two games.

&amp;#x200B;

**Heat Check:**

* Eastern Conference:  The Indiana Pacers are on a 7-game winning streak, the longest in the NBA.  The second longest winning streak belongs to the Brooklyn Nets with 5.  Both the Celtics and Pacers are 8-2 over their last 10 games, and the 76ers are 7-3.  On the flip side, the Cavaliers and Hawks are both 3-7 over their last 10, and the Bulls and Knicks are each 2-8.  However, of those four teams, only the Hawks have a losing streak of longer than 3.
* Western Conference:  As usual, pretty much every team in the West has a winning or losing streak of less than 2.  The exceptions are the Nuggets and Rockets, who are both on 3 game winning streaks, and the Clippers and Timberwolves, who have lost 3 and 4 in a row, respectively.  For what it‚Äôs worth, the Suns have won 2 games in a row.  Over their last 10 games, the Nuggets are 8-2, and the Lakers and Warriors are both 7-3.

"What do you think it‚Äôd take your team to trade for T.J. Warren? Assuming the Suns even make him available, he‚Äôs 25 years old, putting up awesome stats and is probably the most underrated player in the league aside from John Collins. 

Personally, I‚Äôd like to see the Lakers give up one of their young core pieces if they would even take that, but what do you think it‚Äôd take your team to get him?

"The Automation of Reffing to Eliminate Terrible Games So, as most of us would agree, the refs this year have been terrible. It's clear the NBA has a problem, but what can be done? Here's 2 ideas with an explanation of exactly how it would improve things:

&amp;#x200B;

1:Lasers or similar tech on the OB line and around the rim and backboard.  This would be fairly easy to implement and would provide an instant call as to whether someone stepped out of bounds, or where the ball hit or passed in/out of the cylinder and backboard.   Imagine if the Refs never had to watch the OB lines, or make goal tending calls around the cylinder/backboard area.  This frees a bunch of the Refs attention to watching player vs. player interactions.  I imagine if the refs only had to watch the players, the foul calls would get a bit better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there are also other areas where robots/lasers could be used to automate certain types of calls as well.  Double dribble floor sensors?  Clock related calls? You get the idea.  The main point is not to eliminate refs, but to free as much of the refs attention to making the calls like fouls, that computers can't call.  The more focus they have on player vs. player interactions, the better the quality of reffing would be.  We've all seen games lost due to bullshit OB or goal tending calls, this would eliminate those and hopefully improve the foul calling quality.   

&amp;#x200B;

2: NBA games are big business. How hard would it be to train and hire more video replay refs.  There could be a few teams of video refs, instead of a few guys in NJ.  Enough of them to carefully watch each game and provide nearly instant help in grey area situations, could greatly improve the accuracy of some calls.  This is a tough thing to decide where this would be appropriate, because you don't want to drag a game on forever with stoppage time and video reviews.  There are many areas though in which it seems like this could help. The refs have such stupid rules about what is allowed to be reviewed, but maybe a separate video team could make it easier to review a few more things during the game, without slowing the game down noticeably.  As part of this I think each coach should be given an option of 1 or 2 reviews which they can use and a time out gets taken away if they are wrong, or something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you all think! I'm sure lots of us have had good ideas about how to change this terrible ref situation, these are just my two cents.

"Why does Eric Gordon continue to be a streaky player and is able to play through slumps, but Melo was canned after two bad performances. I preface this by saying its shows in the defensive stats that the Rockets defense has gotten worse after him leaving, and the Rockets are still a up and down team.

So yes Melo has regressed and was struggling a bit as a Rocket, but to scapegoat him the way they did is really bullshit. Melo had his best game of the season two games prior to him being ''Cut'' or whatever they want to call it. he had 26 points on 9-12 shooting and played pretty well after that as well with 17 points on 8-14 shooting.

Now my main issue with this is people bringing up his lack of defense as an argument when Mike has shown to not care for defense in the past, yes he has adapted his style to fit the times but no one on the Rockets is performing incredibly in defense.

Which brings me to Eric Gordon, he has continued his streak of playing well for about 3 to 5 games and then not being able to hit a shot, while being inserted and taken out of the starting lineup. But obviously Melo wasn't afforded the same luxury.

The fact that some people believe he doesn't even belong in the league is stupid, yeah he nearly isn't as good as he was but he belonged on the Rockets and was scapegoated for the entire teams struggles.",0
"Devin Booker is the best shooting guard in the league not named Harden It is sad to look at these threads like the dumb Nate Duncan and Danny LeRoux thread where Nate Duncan failed to rank Booker in the top 10 shooting guards again showing his inexplicable bias once again while Danny LeRoux managed to put Donovan Mitchell ahead of Booker.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunatelky reddit users are consistently repeating this type of non-sense putting players like Beal, DeRozan, McCollum or Mitchell ahead of Booker.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets take a look, among all the other in the conversation he is first in scoring and assists while being the 2nd most efficient despite having had a hand injury early in the season and no training camp and having probably the worst setup around him  as all others besides DeRozan play with great PGs or in Mitchell's case a pass first PG.

"Ricky Rubio Trade Ideas I want to start out by saying I am a Jazz fan because I am a Rubio fan. I am not from any NBA city, so my team to watch changes as my favourite player changes team. I have had so much fun watching the Jazz these past 2 years and I want to find some mutually beneficial trades, both for Ricky and for Utah. 

1) **To Spurs: for Patty Mills and Donte Cunngingham**

Why is this good for Utah? 

It's pretty obvious that Utah needs a point guard that can shoot threes. In a lot of our plays, we run either Ingles and Mitchell as distributor, and we often find Ricky standing right out side the three point line. The same play would obviously benefit the team more if the recipient can knock down these three pointers more consistently. Mills can do that for you. Donte Cunningham can provide a (slightly) quicker defender for the team at the 4 spot, compared to Favors. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why would the Spurs do it?

With Murray out, spurs needs a better distributor to play Pop ball. Walker isn't ready to be the main point guard yet and we can agree that Forbes is better as a catch and shooter rather than a distributor. Running PnR with Rubio and Aldrige would prove to be very effective as he has done the same in the Wolves with Kevin Love and then KAT. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) **To Pistons: for Reggie Jackson**

Why is this good for Utah?

They need another shot creator outside of Donovan when the offensive scheme breaks down. Reggie Jackson can do that for them. Also stretches the floor more, same reason as the Spurs trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why would Pistons do it?

They played a 37 years old Jose Calderone for 24 minutes the other day. It is pretty obvious that they are desperate for someone with elite floor vision to feed them lobs to Blake and Drummond. They already have pretty decent spacing, adding Rubio can accumulate more PnR points in their offense.

"What's the deal with Boban Marjanovic? So, although we mostly know of him as kind of a meme from being a big friendly giant, Boban's play makes him more than just a meme.  I'm trying to figure out exactly what the issue is that's limiting him to being played only 11 minutes a game.  Is it conditioning?  Is it his defense?

The advanced stats paint a picture of an incredibly efficient offensive dynamo, and have consistently done so every year.  His PER is the highest in the league of qualified players.  His .685 TS% is 2nd in the league and right ahead of notably decent shooter Steph Curry.  

He's not just a rim-running center of the Tyson Chandler/Deandre Jordan mold, 35.5% of his baskets are unassisted.  These are largely off of his goofy but balletic post-ups and elite offensive rebounding leading to second chance opportunities.  He's not rangy but he's a good midrange shooter and an above average free throw shooter.  His OREB% of 16% puts him right in between Andre Drummond and Tristan Thompson, two of the league's premier offensive rebounders.

There's no way his defense or other qualities are offsetting his play this much to only be giving him 11 minutes a game.  I know that he is often only put in the game in situations he can thrive in on defense and that defensive stats are noisy, but his DRating this season so far is 99.6, an extremely solid rating.  

Is it just the eye test?  What other arguments can we make to get our lovable giant in the game more?",0

"[Discussion] Which NBA player gets the most with the least talent? Which NBA player gets the least with the most talent? Growing up, I watched a lot of baseball - and my favorite player was a guy named David Eckstein. See, from a pure talent perspective, Eckstein was probably the worst player in the league. He stood a meager 5'7"", and some teammates said that was a generous listing. He couldn't hit for power, and sometimes it seemed like he could barely throw the ball from shortstop to first. And yet, Eckstein enjoyed an excellent 10-year career, complete with two all-star appearances, two World Series championships, and the 2006 World Series MVP award.

How did Eckstein manage this? Quite simply, he got an awful lot out of the little talent he had. He was reasonably well-known for his baseball production, but he was most famous for his ""heart"" and ""hustle"" and ""grit"" - descriptors that sportswriters deployed *ad nauseam* during his career. Eckstein was my childhood hero because he showed me - the shortest kid on my little league baseball team - that I didn't need to be as tall or strong or fast as the other kids to make an impact.

This, to me, is one of the most important metrics by which an athlete's career should be judged. Anyone can be born with raw talent, but it takes a special personality to succeed without it. Of course, the true legends have both the talent *and* the heart, but if I'm picking a role model for my son, the latter is more important. I'm far more impressed by the guy who worked his ass off to become a serviceable role player than by the all-star who could have been so much more. And ultimately, I think we as sports fans should emphasize this more than we do when considering a player's legacy.

So, whose legacies are most strengthened by their lack of natural talent? Conversely, whose careers don't look nearly as impressive in light of their innate gifts? Discuss.",0

"Say both get a jumpshot, who has the highest ceiling? Giannis or Ben Simmons? I'd say Ben Simmons. His IQ for the game is higher, he's a far superior passer, and he has potential to be a better defender than Giannis.

No knock to Giannis though, he's a pioneer in the whole ""6'8+ point guard"" archetype of players. I just don't think if both were to hit their peaks, he could be as good as Simmons due to reasons stated above.

What do you guys think?",0
"Dirk Nowitski is absolutely the best International player to play in the NBA. Its not debatable Let me start by saying I've seen Drazen Petrovic play. I was always a fan. That said..Dirk is still the best. He accomplished more ..he changed the game and the position he played.  He played way longer. You can't give a guy THE BEST title based on ""what ifs"" What's ifs are its own thing. Just because LeBron says Petro was the best doesn't make it so. ",0

"The conversation of ""International"" players and why Hakeem is more of an American basketball player than an International one. The conversation is not about heritage, it is about development of their game. Hakeem is a Nigerian person.  He is an American basketball player.

Hakeem was originally a soccer goalkeeper in Nigeria as well as a handball player.  (sidenote, can you imagine if he mastered being a keeper? That would have been unfair.)

Anyways, he was then discovered as a possible basketball prospect and moved to Houston to TRY OUT for the Cougars. He wasn't even guaranteed a spot at this point.  

Eventually, yes, he became a god but it was through the tutelage of an american coach at an american college in america.  Hakeem would later [play on the 1996 US National Team for the Summer Olympics](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DUUx04KXcAAdCV_.jpg)

This conversation around here lately about who the best ""international"" player is, is being muddied by people misunderstanding of the term with regard to the argument.  Hakeem was born outside of America, but he was as much an American basketball player as LeBron or David Robinson or Shaq because he developed in America by American systems.  Other types of guys like this are Patrick Ewing.  He was foreign-born.....but he was developed in America.  

Drazen, Dirk, Sabonis, Schmidt, Manu are examples of guys who played in international systems and developed in countries outside of America.  Embiid even counts in this area as he was active in basketball camps in Africa, even though he did hone his skills further in Kansas. But the names above are the types of people who are considered when talking about international talents.  Hakeem grew his basketball talent in America.

Hakeem was not the best international basketball player.  He was the best player who was born outside of America, yes.  But he was an American basketball player, while being a Nigerian person.  ",0

"Russell Westbrook has played some the worst offensive basketball of his career in December and the Thunder are 5-3: Is this a good sign or concerning? In December, he's averaging 16.4 PTS and 10.5 Assists on 36.4/29.3/58.8 splits while taking more shots per game than he scores and averaging 5 TOPG. He's been playing better defensively and his passing is up to his standards, but since his rookie year, this is probably his worst shooting stretch of his career. He's coming off an ankle injury and knee surgery before the season.

&amp;#x200B;

How should this be looked at? Should it be viewed as good because the Thunder are playing well despite his poor shooting and he should pick it up later in the season? Or should his poor shooting be viewed as concerning? ",0

"The Denver Nuggets has held 13 teams to under 100 points this season Currently the Nuggets are the 4th best defense in the NBA, per NBA.com stats (DRtg).

Also, they held 13 opponents to under 100 points, which leads the league. They did that while having the most missed games by injured players so far (the count is at 120 games missed by injured players).

In the recent stretch, they are missing their two best defenders (Paul Millsap and Gary Harris), and yet kept Memphis, Oklahoma City and Toronto to under 100.

Between those 13 games where they kept teams under 100 points, you will find OKC (twice), Clippers, Memphis (twice), Lakers, Toronto and the *Warriors*. As far as that Warriors defeat go, Denver and Toronto are the only teams that have defeated the Warriors at full force (meaning: Steph, KG, Klay and Draymond playing).

People kept saying that this was not sustainable. Well, it is. People keep saying that Denver isn't a great defensive team. Well, I believe right now we are past the coincidence factor on why most teams keep missing shots only against Denver.

And, while at that, they are doing all this while being the 2nd youngest team in the league.

They should be taken seriously.

"Weird stat - first points scored in a game make a big difference in outcome In the previous 5 seasons home teams have won 58.1% of the regular season games (6150 games).

"Why is Lonzo Ball's Defense so Good? This is my first time i took something like this seriously, it would be appreciated if you left some comments and what i should or shouldn't change, and Sorry for how long it is.

&amp;#x200B;

While Lonzo Ball‚Äôs offense has been lacking a bit, his defense has been outstanding. And why is that? His ability to intercept passes is why, many of the steals or deflections he has is because of him having outstanding reads and knowing where the passing lanes are. If you look at the defensive highlights he has, many of his steals is him intercepting passes. And the other steals is him reaching around the ball handler and poking it towards another player for them to pick it up and make a pass. While Lonzo does get the steal and make the pass himself, that isn‚Äôt the majority of the steals. Next, his ability to stay with his defender or to switch to another player. While this doesn‚Äôt show up in the box score, many people see him doing this on the court. And many people respect him for that. This also includes the ability to dodge picks, which he is exceptional at. For an example, I would like to point out a play he had against the Spurs which you can find on Bleacher Report‚Äôs video on his defense (its very close to 1:00 in the video) Here is a quick rundown for you. He starts on the top of the key, follows his man to the paint, dodges a two picks, keeps with his man until his man get the ball on the top of the opposite key and he steals the ball before the ball bounces out of bounds. Thats alot for one possession, and I‚Äôm happy to see someone like that putting that much effort in on a defensive play. Lastly, his shot blocking skills, his height does contribute to his blocks, he 6 ft, 6 in. The estimated average height of a point guard in the NBA is 6, 3‚Äù Lonzo is 3 inches taller than the average point guard in the NBA. And when height contributes so much, especially in basketball, it helps a tremendous amount for him and his shot blocking. I will still give him credit where it is due, he knows how to block shots, he had a chase down block on Darren Collision and John Wall. Lonzo‚Äôs defense is outstanding, and he goes against point guards, the players who usually have the best scoring abilities on the team.",0

"Should Jokic be in the MVP discussion? Now hear me out before you go crazy on me. I know that he is not averaging the most points in the league and not amongst centers either. But we are talking about the ""most valuable player"", not the best scoring player. Jokic, even when scoring 4pt, he contributes so much by dropping like 10 or more assists and getting the same amount of boards. Even when he had off shooting nights they have won their games because of him contributing in so many ways.

I always hear people saying AD, Harden and so on .. but how are their records doing? How valuable are they really if they score 40 points and they still lose or are not even in a playoff spot?

Now I know the season is long and we don't know if the nuggets can sustain this great type of play and run in general, but if the season ended today I absolutely believe Jokic should and has to be in the MVP discussions.",0
"Sacramento and Dallas: A tale of two schedules Sacramento and Dallas have been two surprising Western Conference teams this season, both sporting winning records as they near the 30 game point of the season.  

An important question is - can they keep this up?  A simple answer may lie in their strength of schedules (SOS).  [Per ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/stats/rpi/_/sort/SOS), Sacramento has jumped to a 16-13 record while being tied for the **6th toughest schedule in the league**.  This indicates that they have succeeded in the face of adversity and will have an easier road going forward.

In contrast, the Dallas Mavericks, at 15-13, hold [sole possession](http://www.espn.com/nba/stats/rpi/_/sort/SOS) of **easiest schedule in the league** to date. Expect their schedule to get more difficult as they face tougher teams at the top of both both conferences.  They certainly won't end the year with the easiest strength of schedule due to the tough Western Conference.

In summary, I would expect Sacramento to finish ahead of Dallas in the standings at the end of the season.  Dallas's opponents will ramp up in difficulty while Sacramento will face an easier road.",0

"Why are teams playing each other in back to back games more often this year? This may have been covered on here before but I didn‚Äôt see it. I‚Äôve noticed this year teams are playing against each other with less time in between games, sometimes on back to back games, sometimes even back to back nights. The Mavericks have a stretch coming at the end of the month in which they will play the Pelicans back to back immediately followed by back to back games against the Thunder. This clearly seems like a bad idea because if one team has a player injured during just that stretch the other team has an obvious advantage over the rest of the league and for the purposes of head to head tiebreaks. Does anyone have any info on why the NBA would schedule this way; is it related to reducing back to backs? ",0

"Lakers refusing to trade young talent. Smart move? Could that change? LeBron doesn't have the same front office influence in LA that he had in Cleveland. But he has some leverage in that regard

They have the pieces to put together a veteran heavy team that would have a good shot at making the ECF for the next 2-3 years. When Rondo and Stevenson were signed I thought they were doing just that. But it appears those guys were just stop gaps and that they are committed to keeping their prospects (at least until next year's free agency). 

The conventional approach would be to go all-in before a dominant player like Lebron declines. But I think the risk - reward factor for the Lakers and for LeBron's legacy is too high. If they gut the team and don't win a chip, the rebuild in the west could take years and years. It could also really alter the perception of LeBron in years to come (especially among younger fans). I think it's wise for the teams future and for LeBron's legacy to keep the Lakers young core together. 

Obviously the dominance of the Warriors factors into this thinking. But there are other factors that are unique to this situation. LeBron could have a lasting effect on guys like Ingram and Lonzo. He could take on a player/ Coach role with reduced minutes and lengthen his career.  And after he retires he would have a good relationship with the city. 

There are only a few scenarios where I would consider throwing this plan out the window. 
1) If KD left GS and was open to joining the Lakers 
2) If the Lakers were able to get 2 legit superstars to join LeBron through trade/ Free Agency. I don't see how this would be financially possible but if the Lakers could get say Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard then I would obviously trade everyone and their mama. 

I'm wondering how Lakers fans feel?

Realistically speaking,  what is the best case scenario?

"What is this subs opinion on Buddy Hield at the moment I feel like Hield's breakout season has been slightly overshadowed by all the hype surrounding DeAaron Fox and the kings in general. Having a career year putting up a touch under 19 a game on 48/43/83 splits on a team that is current right in the playoff hunt in the west is something that I think deserves a bit more praise.

Comparing his season to Donovan Mitchell it's pretty hard to argue that he hasn't out preformed Mitchell thus far, I'm in no way saying that Hield is the better player, just that the numbers made for an interesting comparison.",0

Are BI‚Äôs days as a Laker numbered regardless of fit/success? ,0
"Why saying a player shot X%/X%/X% in a game can be very deceptive Imagine a game where you get 100 turns and each turn you get to choose one of three challenges. The first challenge gets you 3 points if you succeed, second one gets you 2 points and the last gets you 2 chances to get a point each time.

Now, let's say I said, ""I won 50% percent of my 2 point challenges, 40% of my 3 point challenges, and when I chose the 2 chances for 1 point challenge, I won 90% of the time."" How would you go about calculating how many points I got in my 100 turns?

You might start by looking at how many points I got on average per attempt of each challenge, right? So you'd say, ""chingt made half his 2 point challenges, which means that on average, chingt scored 1 point (2 * 50%) per 2 point challenge attempted.""

Here's the math for each challenge type:

1. 2 point attempt: 2 * 50% = 1 point per attempt
2. 3 point attempt: 3 * 40% = 1.2 points per attempt 
3. 2 attempts at one point: 2 * 90%  = 1.8 points per attempt

That leaves you with a formula like this:

total points scored = (2 point attempts) * 1 + (3 point attempts) * 1.2 + (2 attempts at 1 point) * 1.8

You're missing three variables here that could be almost anything so you still have no clue how much I scored. All we know about those variables is that they add up to 100 -- you got 100 attempts. We have no idea *how many of each type* of challenge you attempted, and because you averaged a very different number of points per attempt of each type, that distribution matters a lot.

So let's say you took 98 2 point challenges, 1 3 point challenge and one ""2 attempts at 1 point"" challenge. We can plug those into the formula, and we get this:

total points scored = 98 * 1 + 1 * 1.2 + 1 * 1.8

A person with that distribution scores 101 points.

Now let's say instead you took just one 2 point attempt, 1 3 point attempt, and 98 ""2 attempts at 1 point"" challenges.

total points scored = 1 * 1 + 1 * 1.2 + 98 * 1.8

That person scored 178.5 points!

Second example player scored 77.5 more points yet both players were 50% on 2s, 40% on 3s and 90% on 2 attempts at one point or ""50%/40%/90%"" and used the same number of chances.

This same scenario plays out all the time in the NBA. Some players draw a ton of fouls, and even a mediocre FT shooter (say 75%) scores more points on one trip to the line (1.5 points on average) than a very good 45% 3 point shooter (1.35 points) or a very good 60% 2 pt shooter (1.2 points on average). 

The X%/X%/X% model completely ignores the importance of the distribution of a players shots, making most players who take a ton of 2s and only the occasional three or free throw look way better than they are and punishing players who are skilled at drawing lots of fouls or who take a high percentage of their shots from three point land.

Moreover, the X%/X%/X% model doesn't include 2 point FG% as a separate percentage. The first number includes *all* FGAs, 3s and 2s, making it even more deceptive. The more 2 point shots you replace with 3 point shots, the lower your FG% will be even if those 3s score you more points per attempt than a 2.",0

The previous record was 141 points, set back on December 11, 1983 against the Detroit Pistons in a 141-130 victory. I should also note that the Nets put up 142 in the first 4 quarters of a game on 3/28/92 against the Golden State Warriors that eventually went into OT.

In terms of 4-quarter basketball games, the Nets have never had a better night offensively at home than what they did against Atlanta.",0
"Is it time to maybe consider that Westbrook is declining? I‚Äôm not talking about gradual decline, I mean a steep drop off in play. Offensively, he just doesn‚Äôt look the same out there. His numbers on the season are 20.7 PPG on 43/25/62 splits or 49.3 TS%. Defensively I‚Äôve seen Thunder fans saying he‚Äôs been good on that end. He did have another knee surgery this offseason, is it time to consider that Westbrook might never be the same? ",0
"Luka Doncic is on pace to become the 6th rookie in NBA history to average 18 points/6 rebounds/4 assists/1 steal in their first season, and the first to do it since Grant Hill in 1994-95 [Source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts_per_g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=18&amp;c2stat=trb_per_g&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=6&amp;c3stat=ast_per_g&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=4&amp;c4stat=stl_per_g&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=1&amp;order_by=season)

The other 5 players to do this were Grant Hill (1994-95), Michael Jordan (1984-85), Larry Bird (1979-80), Magic Johnson (1979-80), and Alvan Adams (1975-76).

Right now, Doncic is averaging 18.2 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 4.6 APG and 1.1 SPG. Still plenty of time left, but he's on a historic pace right now.",0

"The Toronto Raptors Just Shot 1/12 From Three In The Fourth Quarter In what was an incredible display to witness the Raptors just could not find the bottom of the net. They had countless shots from behind the arc that were completely wide open and just could not capitalise.  
  
Anunoby missed three wide open threes in the quarter and CJ Miles also chipped in with three misses from behind the arc as well. As someone who wanted the Toronto Raptors to win this game it was just unbelievable seeing so many of their shots miss but also more so the fact that they lost their offensive groove and did nothing but shoot 3s. Its as if when the margin reached 7 they felt the urge to rush and shoot 3s and ultimately it cost them a win.",0

"[MacMahon] Kings coach Dave Joerger on Luka Doncic: ""Perhaps there was an idea that there was a ceiling on him. I don't see it, unfortunately for us. But he's great for them and he's great for our league."" Source: https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1074449191894769664

Sounds like Joerger wasn't a fan of the decision to pass on Luka Doncic and it doesn't sound like he was given a reason as to why they did. In my opinion, coaches should be consulted on draft prospects, especially when you're a rebuilding team and the coach is here to oversee it.

"Is Fox‚Äôs shooting sustainable through the season? De‚ÄôAaron Fox was a pretty bad shooter in college and shot 30% from 3 his rookie year (43% from the field as well).

This year he‚Äôs shooting close to 40% from 3 and over 50% from the field.

Do we ignore the past two years of inefficient shooting for these past 29 games? Do you think we will see a regression to the mean as the year goes on, or will Fox sustain (and improve) on his hot shooting?",0
"End of quarter heaves and historical 3pt% So as everyone knows, more 3pt shots are taken now than ever before. Due to that, end of quarter heaves are less of a % of a team and player's 3pt attempts. For low volume 3 shooters this seems like it could skew their 3pt% substantially. Any merit to this or would the effect be negligible? Is there a way to or a stat that excludes those types of attempts?",0

Kemba Walker's shot has fallen off a cliff since the start of the season, but luckily Charlotte has been able to maintain a near .500 record during his slump so they haven't fallen in the standings. ",0
"In light of the foul call debates, would you say that there any star players besides Harden that DO fairly get foul calls? I would argue no. I'd like to preface this by saying this isn't meant to be a Harden hate thread.  This post has more to do with the perception of star officiating then the officials themselves. Reading over the Kawhi threads regarding foul calls got me to thinking about how it seems like every single fanbase complains about how their star player(s) never get fouls called fairly for them.  Off the top of my head  I've seen this said multiple times about:

* Lebron

* Steph

* Kawhi

* Dame

* AD

* Jrue

* Wall

* Kyrie

I'm certainly not saying that these players aren't getting calls missed against them, and with players like Steph and Lebron (ignoring the offensive foul debate) it looks to be especially apparent.  But it seems to me that there are constant complaints about every single star not getting foul calls like they are the exception to the rules that surround star players, when in reality it actually seems to be common.  I constantly see comments like ""if xx got foul calls like Harden he'd average 45 points a game"", but that's comparing against a massive outlier as far as foul calls go.  As unenjoyable and frustrating as his game is to watch sometimes, you can't argue that he has elevated the act of drawings fouls to a new level, and expecting every single star to be called like he is is kind of ridiculous.

This isn't to say that the officials are so just so awful that they're missing calls on every star player.  Officiating is a tough job, and there is a lot of room for error in a pressure enviornment officials are in.  They make a lot of mistakes, but I think that a lot of the hate towards them is based on bias because so many fans watch their star players more closely than everyone else, so when they get fouls against them it's more apparent.

Just something I noticed after being on this sub for a while, feel free to call me out if you think I'm off base.",0
"Broussard on Kuzma: ""Kuzma is a better fit with Lebron than Ingram, there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. [...] He has that dog. [...] watching Kuzma learn and grow under Lebron, I feel like I've felt when I watched Pippen. [...] Every year you could see improvement with him under Jordan."" [It was on The Herd, a sports television and radio show on FS1.] (https://streamable.com/ivh55)  

Full Quote  

&gt; Broussard: Kuzma is a better fit with Lebron than Ingram, there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. [Why?] Well, one he can catch and shoot, and like you said he has that dog. Because Lebron is such a facilitator that his second guy... Think of the best fits with him as a second guy, Kyrie Irving - dog, Dwyane Wade - dog, like when they get it, they just go and get it. Kuzma, I mean sometimes you're like pull him back a little bit, but you like that he's so aggressive in terms of trying to score. [...] Look, I'm not saying Kyle Kuzma is as good as Scottie Pippen. I don't think he'll be as good as Scottie Pippen, they're totally different types of players. Pippen was a better playmaker, defender, and Kuzma is more of a scorers' mentality, but watching Kuzma learn and grow under Lebron, I feel like I've felt when I watched Pippen. Pippen didn't just come into the league this great. He averaged 8 points as a rookie, 14 the next year I think, then 16-17, all-star his third year.  Every year you could see improvement with him under Jordan. [...]",0
"Rockets fans: Do you actually admire James Harden's style of play? I'm a Laker fan first and foremost so if you think I have a bias, it's probably true. However, I love the game itself. I been watching it since I was a kid and went to my first game in 1994 when I was 5 and been addicted since.

Now that's out of the way, I can't stand James Harden and the way he plays: 
-Creating nonexistent fouls because he runs into the defender or flops
-falling for no reason after a shot to act like he got hit -step backs that were travels back in the day but I guess it isn't anymore
-complains all the time when he didn't get those fake fouls

There are more but I don't want this to be longer than it is. My fear is that kids will look up to him and try to replicate his style and the game just goes to s**t.
 
Rocket fans and fans of basketball in general, do you actually like James Harden ?

"Props to Josh Kroenke I'd like to point out that both Masai Ujiri and Tim Connelly were Josh Kroenke's discoveries. He gave them both their first GM jobs, and both are killing it. 

Masai deserves credit for not trading Lowry or DeRozan and not firing Dwayne Casey until it was clear the team needed a change. He maximized DeRozan, and got amazing value in trades along the way. He drafted well, and built a deep team. 

Connelly deserves credit for coming into a bad situation, and righting the ship in only a few years. He acquired Plumlee and Barton via trade, and drafted a number of solid players. Jokic, Harris, and Murray are guys he pulled out without a top 5 picks, while his peers squandered them. His team is one of the youngest in the league, yet in 1st place in the brutal Western Conference. He too has built one of the deepest teams in the West, a testament to his scouting prowess. Here's ESPN shitting on him when he first took over the team:

http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11865367/how-denver-nuggets-became-nba-biggest-disappointment

It's impressive that Kroenke was able to replace Ujiri without missing a beat, pretty much all of Denver's fanbase was upset over losing him. They are both alike in many ways, and neither has had a real signature FA acquisition (unless you count Millsap for Connelly, but is he really a top 25 player?). They have built through trades and the draft, and done a damn good job of it. Thought I'd point that out while they play each other.",0

"Eh, not completely confident but I'd bet we're more than likely to sneak in. We're 10-10 after starting 2-9, just 3 games back from the 8 seed right now. Still a lot of basketball left. 

And I really don't feel like analyzing every financial scenario involved, but remember that the luxury tax is a progressive tax. You pay a higher % tax the more you spend. Without analyzing it, I'd be willing to bet the $7 million in salary + the additional luxury tax on that would be far greater than what you'd bring in with 3 (at most) home playoff games if you did this trade. 

Not to mention, we're not in a position to give up future assets regardless of the scenario. We've got three guys on max contracts, so we'll need guys on rookie deals to fill out a team if we plan on trying to compete. Or, if we blow it up, we'll need to use those picks to draft and develop young talent. We're kind of between a rock and a hard place thanks to our GM. ",0

the best part was he then proceeded to contrast him with Rondo who, incidentally, also didn't know his father growing up",0
"We could've been but...

1) We didn't trade him for Lonzo, so we possibly could've had them both. The trade was for Brook Lopez and the pick that netted us Kuz (correct me if I'm wrong though). 

2) Sure, this season he would've been a better fit offensively with Bron, but since it's looking like Lonzo's shooting is starting to get better, it's a tossup for the next 3 seasons that Bron's guaranteed to be here. Also, say we kept DLo and traded Lonzo, we now have a gaping hole on defense, where Lonzo is elite at and DLo is slightly below average. Josh Hart can't guard everybody. 

3) DLo's had 1 and a half seasons to develop in a pressure free environment, and we'll never know if he looks as good now compared to if Magic didn't trade him. He would've had to learn how to play as an off guard since I'm 100% sure Luke Walton would've made Lonzo the primary playmaker of the team last season. ",0

If you're hooking up AD and Lebron you sort of need to plan on any future draft picks being bottom 5 for the next few seasons, so it'd have to be a bunch of future draft picks and hope that Lebron gets old and AD doesn't re-up when his current deal runs out. That's a lot of ""ifs"" though and I'm not sure you want to trade a superstar like AD for lottery tickets, even if there's a lot of them. It's also tough to sell your fanbase on being good 5-6 years down the road.",0

&gt; Secluded by the sequoia trees that lined the edges of the pavement, Dion stared into Kevin's eyes. As they basking in the summer heat, their shirts grew heavy with sweat. Soon, Kevin removed his. Dion followed. The rest of their clothes weren't far behind.

&gt; Kevin's long torso pushed up against Dion's chest as he posted up in the paint. He knew he could shoot at any time, but he wanted to savor the moment, as he felt a sweet that wasn't his. It felt new.

&gt; Finally, he shot the ball. It soared through the air, like a sun reaching it's peak and then setting in fast-forward. And Kevin thought about how he never wanted the sun to set on this day. Not today. Not ever.

&gt; The ball rattled off the side of the rim and Dion jumped up to catch it. ""No good, baby."" Dion was kidding, obviously, but how Kevin longed to hear those words with sincerity from Dion's dark lips.",0

Up until that point Tucker had never taken more than 3.5 threes a game, and was only considered a threat from the corner (he still kind of is that way he just takes a lot of 3s from there).  Ariza has been taking at least 5 threes a game every year since 2015, and takes them from all over the court.  I know that might not sound like a big deal, but it really is.  The consensus with Tucker back then was he will play good defense, but in the playoffs just help off him and make him really prove he can hit 3s.  With Ariza that is not really considered a viable strategy. ",0

Kobe Bryant also had a team and kept himself in top shape. And suggesting that the fact that Kobe got injured or had knee surgery (wear and tear) is evidence he did it wrong is honestly stupid. Other than knee surgeries to clean up ligaments (which no amount of training, prep or maintenance can prevent) most of Kobe's injuries were things like broken fingers, broken wrists, and turned ankles when stepping on someone's foot. Nothing can prevent these things before they happen. ",0

&gt; &gt;So a formula of (FGA)x(eFG%-LgeFG%)x2 + (FTA)x(FT%-LgFT%)x1 would be more accurate, and also produce tangible ""points"" for us.
&gt; 
&gt; Your formula does not account for account for and-1‚Äôs, technical free throws, flagrant foul free throws, and 3PT free throws.

A final note on this: Your stat wants to measure tangible points. And my (hopefully constructive) critique of it was connected mostly to that aspect. I understand why you wrote that part about and-one's etc. - It's because you recall, from the time you wondered where that 0.44 got there, the explanation given to that number. 

That 0.44 makes sense, for what TS wants to measure, and that's **a proxy for per-possession efficiency**. That's where TS shines - it let's us know what players produce good offensive production per possession, but in the process it loses connection to the raw points added by the player.

As an efficiency stat, that has merit, but again, for ""points added"" it doesn't make sense. I would suggest either using the formula I offered, or changing the name to ""efficiency units"" or something similar, since it's not points added. See for example RAPM (now in a slightly shittier version, RPM), a stat whose units are actual **points**.",0

\*(note: 71 and 72 Thurmond series box scores were VERY incomplete, but I could just subtract from his playoff totals and the other series box scores, which had more intact data)

&amp;nbsp;

In 2 playoff meetings, Wilt held Kareem below 50% shooting and 30 ppg both times, and below 50% TS once. Got almost 35 ppg once, but very inefficient.

In 3 playoff meetings, Thurmond held Kareem below 50% shooting and 30 ppg all 3 times, and to 45% TS and 23 ppg twice.

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, maybe they had help. Eg Thurmond's teammate Clyde Lee averaged 7.5 rpg, 13 rpg, and 17 rpg in the 3 series, maybe they were just constantly double teaming Kareem. But maybe not, idk.

Kareem never met either of them in the playoffs again after that. Kareem missed the '75 playoffs then went to the Lakers in '76. Thurmond moved to the Eastern Conference in '76 and retired after '77. Wilt retired after '73.",0

He was drafted by Portland who seemingly didn't want to play him (he played 12.6 minutes/game there his first season), and as soon as he got meaningful minutes his production went up and he become one of the most lethal scorers in the league at the time. There's a lot of ifs about his career but even discounting his time in the NBA before his tragic death, he would still be in the conversation of one of the greatest international players, doing just about everything he could in Europe before moving on to America.",0

Bottom:
If we‚Äôre talking worst AND if it‚Äôs over the lifetime it‚Äôs hard to argue with the Clippers under Sterling, but right now the Clippers are a great org (with an elite coach and a respectable Owner) on the upswing and the future looks bright. 

The Knicks era under Dolan has been disastrous with no end in sight.

Bulls and Suns FO‚Äôs have had a tough year in 2018.... 

But IF we‚Äôre talking about last year - how do you argue against the year the front office of the 76ers had. Colangelo traded the #3 pick (Tatum) and an additional 1st round pick for Markelle ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the yips‚Äù Fultz, an epic and historic bust. As if that‚Äôs not bad enough, Colangelo got caught up and outed in the burner / (normal collar) controversy and turned out he was anonymously disparaging his team‚Äôs best assets (Simmons, Embiid &amp; Coach Brown) on Twitter. Still, they are a great team, and Embiid &amp; Simmons are amazing and the future is bright.",0

"Kyrie has been the closest so he's in the realm of possibility rather than long shot. I feel like someone like Westbrook is more of a longshot because he would have to take so many shots to get there. Curry and Kyrie, along with Harden are probably the best bets with Steph struggling to get foul calls and both Harden and Kyrie can struggle to be efficient from the field at times. Dame I feel like is kind of a long shot because he typically doesn't take that many threes compared to the others and is average to slightly above average in efficiency in making them",0

"I think the thing that saves Cleveland is the fact that Lebron came back, which is huge of course, but I would say that was more Lebron's plan than the front office selling it to him.

"There's a lot more to BBall than being an elite shooter. Anthony Morrow shot 45% on 750 3pa in his first 3 seasons yet he could barely crack rotations. Hield has a lot more to his game than Morrow but he's still at best below average in everything that isn't shooting.
 
Per 100 possessions Hield is scoring 6 more points on 8 more shots compared to Siakam, which isn't a good thing. Siakam is averaging more assists and less TOs despite being a forward while Hield is a guard. They are overall pretty close on offense with Siakam having a higher OBPM and ORPM, especially when you factor in that Siakam can play the 4 which is a tougher position to get shooting from.

They are not at all close on defense. Hield is below average while Siakam is an extremely versatile force of nature. His defensive versatility, instincts, and talent are far more rare and valuable than Hields shooting. When you factor in that Siakam is also close on offense, this isn't a fair comparison.

I guarantee you that every GM in the league would take Siakam in a heartbeat, outside maybe a few who are incompetent. ",0

A team looking to get better now could easily flip dead money and a 2nd round pick for Austin Rivers.


[Example](https://tradenba.com/players?tid=24&amp;tid=26)


Randolph isn't hitting the floor and Sacramento has a lot of dead money in him and Shumpert. Rivers would easily outplay Mason, Ferrel, and Maclemore and would help a Sacramento team that just might grab the 8th seed this year.

"There are definite timing issues and in lots of scenarios we need to agree to a deal before the draft but execute it after Kyrie extends.

I agree with your main point, though. If the Celtics wanted AD they'd have to include Tatum. There was some reason to think they might be able to put the best offer on the table even without Tatum back in the summer--when Jaylen Brown was coming off of a very effective sophomore playoffs where he scored 18.0 ppg and when the Kings pick looked like it had superb chances to be a top 3 pick-- but at this point I don't think there's any way for the Cs to put the best available offer on the table without including Tatum.",0

He can't shoot, and maybe never will be able to shoot league average, but he can do everything else well to good. The main bad thing about him is that once he makes a good play his confidence skyrockets, so then he takes some dumb contested stepback or ill-advised pass.

To answer yours: Maybe we're talking about different people. I'm not sure who Byrd is, but Larry Bird was around 20 pounds lighter than Lebron. Bird also was notorious for drinking a lot of beer, getting into bar fights, and didn't have use the modern nutritional and training advantages we have now. It's the closest estimate we're going to get, so the current evidence is in my argument's favor. unless you have the long distance mileage times of any other superstar NBA athletes who are around 6'8. If you do, then please share. Until then, have fun being on the losing side. ",0
"hahaha lol

1. I don't believe there's any rules in the NBA that states that you have to live in the city for which team you play for.

2. hahahah lol.... best fucking places in the world huh? yea okay buddy, why don't you go visit and see some places around the nation. 

3. Can't wait until they even a way to actually slap the shit out of people thru the internet. You'd be my first victim.... I'd so  slap the shit outta your face your mouth would fall the fuck off ",0

Yup. We arguing about aging/declining PGs,0
He doesn‚Äôt contribute to winning basketball against elite teams in the playoffs ,0
Dwight Howard conflicted between Ron and Oubre ,0
Lol,0
I don't believe in your argument.,0
Lowry all day. CP3 is cringe to watch,0
It still hasnt settled into a normal game yet. Spurs are shooting lights out and Forbes is on fire. No one seems to be in sync defensively. Feels like I'm watching a 2K game.,0
Mudiays improvement this year is wild,0
Dropped 44 in the 2 games after them. He‚Äôs back. Even though he‚Äôs hurt now though lol.,0
Could you imagine a Jordan to Jordan alley oop?,0
"Complete scrub who couldn‚Äôt get minutes on the Knicks is going to get on the front page for getting back on an NBA roster. Shouldn‚Äôt be news. Y‚Äôall meme and root for white dudes. It‚Äôs ok, most of y‚Äôall are white, but most of y‚Äôall deny that you do it for some reason ",0
I agree its so cringe,0
on 18 shots.,0
Alright this is cool but wanna explain the 32-5 score,0
"I'm fcking bursting with joy that my boy is still playing. The wiz are gonna love this guy. Pure Hustle, Pure Hair.",0
Yeah dumb people and this is a dumber retort,0
We don't really know yet if CP's in a shooting slump or if he's just wearing down. Give it a few more weeks.,0
agreed,0
Must be nice knowing what you're gonna be at 7,0
Lmaooooo. Yeah you cant call women women thats sexist. ,0
"Bench depth probably, overall health, plus they added Jimmy Late to the roster",0
Lowry. ,0
Rockets and Jazz already have a center. Lakers can't match salary.,0
if a take doesn't get posted was it ever really a take at all? ,0
Damn it‚Äôs really not out there. Like I looked. If he has Twitter you should tweet him and see if he has one still lol ,0
Reggie Jackson ,0
Sparty lighting it up.,0
"Russ' 200 game stretch of triple double. 

Dray being in a position to call KD a bitch.

Steph's elite finishing at the rim and 400 3' s in a season.

Deandre's FT shooting.

Iggy as Finals MVP.

Three point attempts from 5+ feet beyond the arc in the rhythm of an offense. 

Demarcus Cousins shooting over 45% from deep in his half season with the Warriors. ",0
"The Sixers bucket announcement is just horrible.

Ben Simmons..ssssimons.

Shammmmet...shammet

Its so bad its not even funny",0
-ic is really hooping!,0
BlEsS heR HeArt,0
This guy knows.,0
"I mean Jokic is very tall and plays a centre role which is obviously its own form of athleticism.  You could have said the same about Duncan or Dirk, but the athleticism they bring for their position isn't really comparable to a guard for a lot of reasons.
Pierce is probably a reasonable example, although he had elite stop start ability. 

I'm not even trying to shit on Doncic, its not like we can see the future so no ones got the 'right' answer.  I just like Simmons defensive and playmaking ability, combined with where his scoring ability is now and the likelihood he will eventually get some shot.  I dont think Doncic will ever be a great defender.",0
"Agreed but the other person pointed out the Pop/Parker example. You have to be the kind of person willing to go the extra mile, and Lebron seems to have thay",0
Because we want him,0
Rockets and Jazz already have their starting centers. And Vucevic isn't as effective as a PF.,0
"Meh ... apparently Rivers wanted absolutely nothing to do with Phoenix and it would have been more drama for ESPN and r/NBA to circlejerk about for the next few weeks.

Plus it ""looks good"" to other players that Phoenix wasn't going to be petty about this.  (As well as with Chandler and Ariza.)  They need all the help they can get trying to rebuild their horrible image.",0
Lololol ,0
"If that dude was actually committed to basketball, there is no reason he can't get to the best version of Deandre Jordan, when they considered him a defensive player of the year candidate. He has the elite size and athleticism, just needs to get stronger. Dude has been in the league for like 3 years now and he doesn't seem to have filled out that frame all that much. ",0
Didn't Lowry have a stretch recently where he scored like 8 points in 4 games?,0
Laker*,0
What a roller coaster,0
indeed,0
"Can you enlighten me to which CBA feature I'm failing to see?

Other than saving some money (which may be a priority) there doesn't seem to be anything special happening",0
Seeing his name as Brad makes me uncomfortable,0
"he did some playoff stuff last year and you could tell that he was a natural.  i was so happy nets got him and he has been great to listen to.  he was great last night talking about plays, dissecting the defense and explaining the scouting reports but didnt make it so technical that it went over your head.

as others have said, i have a feeling he will be on espn or tnt in a few years",0
"No they shouldnt we have more than enough assets and talent, we need to build a competitive team around Booker, Warren and Ayton now.

",0
The human r/yesyesyesyesno,0
If you don‚Äôt believe in Doncic yet after watching his first half of the season then I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you.,0
You can see at the end she looks disappointed as shit,0
"For the lakers, buddy hield",0

"As a Kentucky fan I remember everyone being super hyped about Malik Monk. But wow once I watched them play it was obvious de‚Äôaron ‚ÄúJohn Wall 2.0‚Äù Fox was the most NBA ready. I knew whatever team drafted him was gonna get one of the fastest, best defensive point guards in the league. Monk definitely showed a lot of potential on the offensive side of the ball but I haven‚Äôt followed his NBA career as much. Also when we had KAT everyone loved him. But man Booker was a robotic shooter and I don‚Äôt remember him not finishing on a fast break at all. Definitely reminded me of Klay Thompson and knew he would be great on any team.",0
Not as many as Embiid,0
&gt;The_Star-Spangled_Banner ft.Despacito 2 REMIX!!,0
I'm sure Shaq has had more than 5 but these only started getting recorded in 2001. 1995 and 2000 were the seasons he got the scoring titles and in Orlando he was way more fit. ,0
30. Washington ,0
They signed him for well above market value then traded him as soon as possible for scraps. ,0
If people wonder why NBA players were so skinny back then it was because of the pace and playing that many minutes. ,0
I‚Äôm sure this is totally in the moment and he didn‚Äôt let the camera guy know to make sure to get this and post what was supposed to be a father son moment on the internet just for good PR.,0
"Boucher showing some athleticism, even if he's getting creamed on the boards.",0
"Davis Bertans, Brynn Forbes, and Marco Belinelli",0
"Draymond breaks JV thumb , he's on the floor in pain. Refs ignore him no call. 

Danny Green gets his eyeball poked out, no call.

Norman Powell gets elbowed, he's on the floor bloodied but no call. 

Kawhi gets grabbed fouled consistently but ofcourse no calls.

I'm starting to think the refs really are out to fuck the raptors.",0
It's all we got in Indiana man. He's become one with the Corn. ,0

His fresh fade has evolved.,0

Ahhh the infamous karma whore. Probably hops into opposing team sub's game threads to compliment their players too and call them a spooky team,0
Fuck Pacers have McDermott... RIP raptors,0
